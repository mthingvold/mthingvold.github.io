<div id="Precambrian"><h2 id="Precambrian">Precambrian</h2></div>
<p>
Composed of several time periods and two eons:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Hadean

<li>
Archean (4-2.5Ga)

<li>
Proterozoic (2.5Ga-542Ma)

<ul>
<li>
Ediacaran period spans last of proterozoic

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
Other time periods are occupied  by a vast expanse of near nothingness
It has been suggested that the precambrian be divided according to planetary events
	– Accretion and differentiation – moon impact
	– Hadean – dominated by heavy bombardment
	from extraterrestrial impacts
	– Archean – First crustal formations and increased
	atmospheric oxygen (BIFs)
	– Transition – first redbeds, and the end of BIFs
	– Proterozoic – Modern plate tectonics and thefirst animals
</p>
	
<p>
Relatively little is known about life in the Precambrian, despite the fact that it makes up 7/8 earth history
</p>
<ul>
<li>
fossils rare

<li>
partially due to metamorphosis

<li>
others have been destroyed by erosion

<li>
Tracing the origins of life is therefore very difficult

</ul>

<p>
Evidence of plate tectonics is largely unknown from the Precambrian, but it's assumed that plates did move, at least rudimentarily
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Most landmass existed as a supercontinent known as Rodinia 1.1Ga to 750 Ma

</ul>

<p>
First evidence of glaciers 2.2 Ga
</p>

<div id="Snowball Earth"><h2 id="Snowball Earth">Snowball Earth</h2></div>
<p>
Break-up of Rodina leaves many smaller continents near the equator
Climate changed weather patterns, carbon dioxide sucked out of atmosphere
Temperature drops to reduced greenhouse, which causes pack ice to build on the poles
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Positive feedback loops causes ice to spread

</ul>

<p>
Hydrologic cycle stops, ice thickens to as much as 1km, oceans become anoxic
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Life clings to refuges in ice cracks and along mid ocean ridges

<li>
Glaciers stop building

</ul>

<div id="Precambrian"><h2 id="Precambrian">Precambrian</h2></div>
<p>
The precambrian is critical, as it is when life originated
	No date for the origin of life is known, but carbon found in rocks dated 3.8Ga
	Well Preserved fossil bacteria recovered from western australia has been radiometrically dated at 3.46Ga
	Formed microbial mounds known as stromatolites
</p>
	
<p>
The first complex, multicellular life forms seem to have appeared 1.5Ga
	Lab experiments show that most of the building blocks of life will form out of inorganic compounds near clays, deep sea vents, etc.
	Was likely stepped transformation:
		Biological monomers - polymers - duplication via completion (from this point, they are considered 'alive' due to the fact they duplicate)
		Over time features that characterize life on earth appear
</p>
<ul>
<li>
liquid bilayer, RNA, proteins

<li>
Dna replaces RNA

</ul>

<p>
Earliest life would have been very, very simple
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Anaerobic: evolved outside the presence of oxygen

<li>
Heterotrophic: a consumer absorbing organic molecules from water

<li>
Prokaryotic: does not have membrane bound organelles

</ul>

<p>
Eventually this led to the evolution of photosynthesizers and first order consumers
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Photosynthesizers freed up oxygen in the atmosphere, which completely changed the global atmosphere

</ul>

<p>
This directly effects life emerging in the proterozoic
Eukaryotic life likely arose due to endosymbiosis
	Prokaryote has a symbiotic relationship with a smaller bacteria, and eventually absorbs it
	This is thought to have occurred again, resulting in chloroplast
	Eukaryote fossils date to 1.7Ga
</p>
	
<p>
Molecular data suggets animals diverged 1Ga~~
Possible evidence of animal trace fossils 570Ma
Ediacaran biota are the first, unrefuted evidence of complex multicellular life on earth.
</p>

<p>
Ediacaran begins with end of global glaciation and subsequent global appearance of a cap carbonate limestone that sits above glacial tilt due to abundant CO₂ in the atmosphere
The end of the ediacaran is marked by the worldwide appearance of trace fossil <span id="Precambrian-Treptichnus pedum"></span><strong id="Treptichnus pedum">Treptichnus pedum</strong>
These organisms are the first record of complex multicellular life on Earth
</p>

<div id="Ediacaran Biota"><h2 id="Ediacaran Biota">Ediacaran Biota</h2></div>

<p>
The first Ediacaran fossils were found in south australia
</p>
<ul>
<li>
oldest most famous assemblage in mistaken point, newfoundland

<li>
Fossils from the ediacaran consist of tubular flattened, and/or frond shaped sessile organisms.

<li>
Referred to as the 'Ediacaran Biota' Because it is unclear where they fit in

<ul>
<li>
may not be directly related to any modern fauna at all

<li>
All are soft-bodied organisms

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
Initially, the Ediacaran organisms were assumed to be animals, but this is probably not the case.
	They may be lichen or algae or protists fungi or microbial colonies or maybe something crazier
</p>

<p>
Some taxa appear to be related to Porifera or Cnidarians
Fossil <span id="Ediacaran Biota-Kimberella"></span><strong id="Kimberella">Kimberella</strong> thought to be basal. shell-less mollusc
	maybe bilaterally symmetrical
</p>
	
<p>
Classification is difficult and fossils are rare which makes interpretting a challenge
the Ediacaran Biota seems to lack active predation, major change from modern ecosystems
	we may also lack evidence
</p>
	
<p>
Another major question is why did it take nearly 4Ga for complex multicellular life to appear
	size limiting factor of available oxygen
	earth was an angry emoji
</p>
	
<div id="Cambrian Period"><h2 id="Cambrian Period">Cambrian Period</h2></div>
<p>
Disappearance of ediacaran biota and end of ediacaran period marks the start of the cambrian
</p>

<p>
The cambrian is the first geo period of the paleozoic era starting 541 Ma and ending 485 Ma
</p>

<p>
	Cambrian marked by profound change in fauna = <span id="Cambrian Period-Cambrian explosion"></span><strong id="Cambrian explosion">Cambrian explosion</strong>
	Subsequent end of the cambrian marked by mass extinction which began around 490 Ma
</p>
	

<p>
Most continental land was clustered in the southern hemisphere over the south pole
	formed supercontinent
cut off ocean circulation, made colder time period avg 7 degrees warmer than today
Marked by dramatic increase in biodiversity
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Coincided with an increase in burrowing complexity and behavior which transformed seabed ecosystems dramatically

</ul>

<p>
Almost all modern animal phyla appeared during this time
</p>
<ul>
<li>
many ogranisms don't belong to any modern group

</ul>
<p>
Many organisms soft-bodied, some shelly
	today more than 2/3 of soft-bodied groups never found in fossils
	Few cambrian fossil beds that preserver soft-bodied organisms
</p>
	
<p>
	<span id="Cambrian Period-Cambrian explosion"></span><strong id="Cambrian explosion">Cambrian explosion</strong>
		Event lasted 20-25Ma several stages
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Diversification of biomineralizing animals and deep, complex burrows

<li>
Radiation of molluscs and brachiopods

<li>
Diversification of trilobites

</ol>

<p>
Contention as to whether cambrian explosion was as dramatic as originally conceived
</p>
<ul>
<li>
does seem innovations which appeared only evolved once

<li>
Statistical evidence suggest the radiation was no faster, but appears that way due to thie appearance of mineralized body parts

</ul>


<p>
Regardless of how explosive this event was the pace of evolution was fast, and several theories for this have been suggested:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Further increase in oxygen

<li>
Increase CaCO₂ in water

<li>
Ozone formation

<li>
Emergence of predator-prey dynamic

<li>
Evolution of eyes

</ul>

<p>
Regardless this all came to a rather crashing end with the cambrian-ordovician mass extinction
</p>
<ul>
<li>
these organisms that survived further radiated in the ordovician, leading to the modern groups we see today

</ul>


<p>
During the cambrian explosion, we have the first record of trilobites, stem mollusks, gastropods, ibvalves, echinoderms, vertebrates and other oddities
Critical time for diversification of life with the appearance of all modern animal phyla
	critical significance: <span id="Cambrian Period-biomineralization"></span><strong id="biomineralization">biomineralization</strong>
</p>
	
<p>
What was the cambrian explosion?
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A phylogenetic event?

<ul>
<li>
Based on a literal reading of the fossils as an actual sudden origin of these lineages

</ul>
<li>
developmental event?

<ul>
<li>
change in genetic architecture allowing for biomineralization, either by new genes or new interaction of genes.

</ul>
<li>
ecological event?

<ul>
<li>
Interaction between organisms promoted mineralized skeletons

</ul>
<li>
Biogeochem event

<ul>
<li>
change in external conditions could've allowed biomineralization

</ul>
</ul>


<div id="Cambrian Period-Why Biomineralization?"><h3 id="Why Biomineralization?">Why Biomineralization?</h3></div>
<p>
We can reject a literal phylogenetic model (and therefore a molecular model), as it is known that groups such as Cnidarians and Bilaterians (<span id="Cambrian Period-Why Biomineralization?-Kimberella"></span><strong id="Kimberella">Kimberella</strong>) had appeared in the Ediacaran
It's known that the development and scale of biomineralization increased dramatically from ediacaran to the cambrian:
	Increased oxygen levels allowing for higher metabolic rates and larger body size
	Changing water chemistry allowing for easier production of calcium carbonate
	Further supported by fossil evidence
</p>
	
	
	
<p>
Kimberella is completely unmineralized
Cambrian Odontogriphus has mineralized radula
Cambrian Wiwaxia has a mineralized radula and kertinized sclerites
Halkeriids have a mineralized radula &amp; calcified sclerites
Early mollusks had shells
</p>

<p>
why did organisms put so much energy into biomineralization?
</p>

<p>
Defence is a natural assumption
Ecosystems and faunas were far more complex than in the Ediacaran, with multiple levels of predation pelagic communities (free swimming orgs and plankton) and infaunalization (living within the substrate)
These changes are consistent with ecological model
</p>


<p>
Realistically the answer is complex with # of factors contributing to cam Explosion
</p>

<div id="Cambrian Period-Cambrian-Ordovician Transition"><h3 id="Cambrian-Ordovician Transition">Cambrian-Ordovician Transition</h3></div>
<p>
Starting 490Ma the terminal cambrian mass extinction ushers in the Ordovician officially beginning 485 Ma
Mass extinction of trilobites/echinoderms
Due to glaciation and ocean anoxia
</p>

<div id="Ordovician"><h2 id="Ordovician">Ordovician</h2></div>
<p>
Ordovician spans 41 Ma. From 485 Ma to 443 Ma
During this time, the souther continents wer collected into gondwana
	started period on equator by the end drifted to south pole
	Initially sea level was high, but as gondwana migrated, ice accumulated in glaciers and global sea level dropped
</p>
	
<p>
Cambrian fauna was still common at this time but paleozoic fauna is on the rise
Ordovician radiation (great biodiversification (GOBE)) was an evolutionary radiation of animal life throughout the ordo. period
	diversification neither fast nor global
</p>
	
<p>
If cambrian known as producing all modern phyla ordo fills out modenr groups, one of the most important speciation events ever
Total number of marine orders doubled and families tripled
Marked increase in complexity of organisms and ecological food chains
Taxa began being localized to specific regions
</p>

<p>
eco tiering seems to have developed during the ordovician
Global fauna that emerged during this time persisted until the end-Permian mass extinction
</p>

<p>
Some major groups that significantly diversified during ordovican include:
	Crinoids and blastoids
	Receptaculitids
	Graptolites
	Nautiloids
	Bryozoans
	Rugos and tabulata Corals
	(I'm not gonna remember these but it will space out the document)
</p>
	

<p>
Radiation of brachiopods, gastropods, echinoderms
Decline of stromatolites
First reefs appear
Fish appear and diversify (jawless known as ostracoderms)
Evidence that terrestrial plants first colonized land in the ordovician
</p>

<p>
A mass extinction seperates ordo-silurian
Dissappearance of 1/3 of all brachiopods and bryozoan families as well as triloboties &amp; graptolites
massive gondwanan ice age
As glaciers grew both the amount CO₂ and sea level dropped hugely
</p>
<ul>
<li>
devestated shallow marine life

<li>
tropical conditions of shallow, epicontinental seas effected most

</ul>

<p>
Beginning of silurian is marked by melting of glaciers and high global sea level.
