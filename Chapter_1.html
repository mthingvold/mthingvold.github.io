	1.1 Real Numbers
		in math we study
			math objects: numbers shapes sets equations functions
</p>
			
<p>
			Math Operations: add divide rotate solve
</p>
			
<p>
			you do math operations on math objects
</p>
			
<p>
			math operations tend to come in pairs of opposites, this is a structuring theme through math
</p>
			
<p>
			Analogy: playing pieces and rules
</p>
			
			
<p>
			Def: a set is a collection of things (here usually numbers)
			Def: the things comprising the set are called the members or elements of the set.
</p>
			
<p>
			Set notation:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
{} - set brackets

<li>
3 backwards - is an element of

<li>
C extended - is a subset of

<li>
| or : - such that
			Example:
				{1,2,3,4,5}
				{2,4}
				{3}
				The set of all people in this room
				the set of all prime numbers 
				{x|x is a prime number}

</ol>
				
<p>
			Element and containment examples
			2E{2,4},3!E{2,4} 2 is in the first set 3 isn't in the second set
			{2,4}C{1,2,3,4,5} 2 and 4 are in the second set
</p>
			
<p>
			U means union
</p>
			
<p>
			Def: the union of two sets A and B is a set A U B consisting of all elements contained in either or both no duplicates
			{3} U {2,4} = {2,3,4}
			!U means intersection	
			Def: the intersection of two sets A and B is a set A !U B consisting of all elements contained in both sets (can be empty)
			{2,4} !U {1,2,3} = {2}
			Def: The Empty set is the with no elements it is denoted with {} or 0 (slash in the middle)
</p>
			
			
<p>
			Special number sets:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
the natural numbers: 1,2,3,4,5.... &lt;- ellipsis <span id="-N"></span><strong id="N">N</strong>= natural number notation

<li>
The integers: ... -2,-1,0,1,2,3...  Z/

<li>
The rational numbers: {a/b|aEZ/,bEZ/,b!=0}  |Q (quotient)

<li>
real numbers: |R
			Note: |N C Z/ C |Q C |RMy_Adhoc_Network

</ol>
			
<p>
			The set of real numbers is completely ordered: given any two real numbers, either they are equal or one is bigger than the other.
			This property allows us to represent the real numbers using the number line
			&lt;----------&gt;
			-1   0     1

 ASSIGNMENT DUE NEXT WEEK
</p>
<blockquote>
Equals and (strict inequality signs provide a way of expressing relations between real numbers, 3=3, 7&gt;3 non-strict 3&gt;=3, 7&gt;=3 
</blockquote>
<p>
			An interval is a special kind of set, a chunk of the number line {x|x&gt;3} all real numbers greater than three
			three ways to express intervals
</p>
<ol>
<li>
x| x &gt; 3 set builder notation

<li>
number line (graphically)

<li>
Interval notation 		(3,inf)   		infinity is not a real number
			A strict inequality corresponds to an open circle corresponds to a round parenthesis &lt; 0 (
			A non-strict inequality corresponds to a shaded circle corresponds to a square bracket &lt;= !0 [

</ol>
			
<p>
			addition and multiplication are commutative a+b=b+a ab=ba
			add and mult are associative a+(b+c)=(a+b)+c a(bc)=(ab)c
			mult distributes across addition a(b+c)=ab+ac (b+c)a=ba+ca
</p>
			
<p>
			Negatives 
</p>
<blockquote>
-a=(-1)a
-(-a)=a
subtracting b is the same thing as adding negative b
</blockquote>
				
<p>
			Invisible ones
</p>
<blockquote>
a=1a(^1)/1
</blockquote>
<p>
			Properties of zero
</p>
<blockquote>
a+0=a
a*0=0
0/a=0 (if a!=0)
a/0 is undefined (if a!=0)	
0/0 is indeterminate (special undefined)
</blockquote>
<p>
			Zero factor property:
</p>
<blockquote>
if ab=0 then a=0 or b=0 or both
</blockquote>
<p>
			Fractions
</p>
<ol>
<li>
adding and subtracting fractions requires a common denominator

<li>
Mult fractions: Top times top bottom times bottom and anything on top cancels with anything on bottom  3/5*1/2*15/7 = 3/1*1/2*3/7= 9/14

<li>
Div fractions: Mult by the reciprocal of the denominator 3/5//2/7=3/5*7/2=21/10

</ol>
