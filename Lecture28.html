Def: the constant e the nat base is defined by e = lim m-&gt;inf (1+1/m)^m 2.71828...
any time you see an e in aquation it's never variable
</p>

<p>
A new compound interest formula for when interset is compounded contiuously:
F(t)=Pe^(rt)
</p>

<p>
To figure out which interest formula to use, look to see if: an m value is given 
or the word continuously or constantly appears
</p>

<p>
eg how much would you receive on ur 18th bday compounded continuously
</p>

<p>
P=3981.97 t=18 r=0.09 F=?
</p>

<p>
F=Pe^(rt)
3981.97e^(0.09*18)
20121.25$
</p>

<p>
the most ccommon exponential function we will work with in this course is f(x)=e^x
</p>
<ol>
<li>
domain : |R

<li>
Range: (0,inf)

<li>
No x-intercepts

<li>
y int: y=1

<li>
hor asymptote y=0 lim x-&gt;-inf e^x=0

<li>
lim x-&gt; inf e^x=inf

<li>
for y = e^kx the k value changes steepness negative k= backwards swoop k&gt;1 steep swoop 0&lt;k&lt;1 shallower

</ol>

<p>
f(x)=e^(x)
f(x<sup><small>2+3)=e</small></sup>(x^2+3)
</p>

<p>
4.2 log functions
in 4.1 we met exponentiation what is the opposite of an exponential
</p>

<p>
a logarithm
def: the log function y= log(a)(x) (a&gt;0,a!=1) is defined by the equivalence
y=log(suba)(x) &lt;-&gt; a^y=x
just as with exponentials we call the number a the base of the logarithm it is written as a subscript informally a log counts how many copies of a go into x
</p>


<p>
find log(sub3)(9) without using your calc
</p>

<p>
3^x=9
3<sup><small>x=3</small></sup>2
x=2
log base 3 9 =2
</p>

<p>
from now on in theis course the main log function we will use is y=lnx (natural log)
</p>

<p>
properties of natural logs
</p>
<ol>
<li>
ln 1=0 

<li>
therefore the x int of y=ln(x) is x=1

<li>
lne=1 lne=lnee

<li>
domain of y = ln(x) is (0,inf) #we have to enhance our domain findiing procedure

<li>
y=ln(x) has no y int

<li>
range of y=ln(x) is R

<li>
y=ln(x) has a vertical asymptote at x=0 as lim x-&gt;0^+ lnx = -inf

<li>
Cancellation property #1: ln(e^x)=x

<li>
cancellation property #2: e^lnx =x if x&gt;0

</ol>


<p>
egfind the domain of y=ln(x-3) 1) Division no, even part, no log, yes x&gt;3 3,infinity
</p>

<p>
eg find the domain of y=1/(lnx)
</p>
<ol>
<li>
even roots? no

<li>
log? yes x has to be bigger than 0

<li>
division? yes  lnx !=0

</ol>
<p>
ln1=0 so x!=0 domain x&gt;0 and x!=1  (0,1)U(1,inf)
laws of logs 
</p>

<p>
Let m&gt; 0 , N&gt;0 &amp; PER then
</p>
<ol>
<li>
ln(MN)=lnM+lnN

<li>
ln(M/N)=lnM-lnN

<li>
ln(M^Power)=PiwerlnM

</ol>
<p>
Notes: a) even though we read left to right, equalities go both ways!
</p>
<ol>
<li>
the third law is most useful

<li>
there are no laws for ln(M_+N) or - no law for ln(M)/ln(N)

</ol>

<p>
eg simplify in 25- ln5
law 2   ln(25/5) = ln(5)
alt answer:
ln(5^2)-ln5
2ln5-ln5=ln5
</p>
