<p>
Evolution - Change in the heritable characteristics of living organisms over successive generation
</p>
<ul>
<li>
descent with modification through earths history

<li>
in terms of genetics, is "change of gene frequency through time"

</ul>

<p>
Two competing viewpoints on life:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Organisms are fixed, and do not change over time

<li>
Organisms change over time

</ul>

<p>
Traditionally, most people believed that life was fixed or static - never changing
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Ex. The plenum or fullness of the world

<li>
Evidence of extinction contradicted this

</ul>

<p>
The discovery of fossils throughout the 19th century showed that strange creature once existed that are no longer alive today
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Transmutation - an early 'pre-evolutionary' model that stated there were direct ancestor-descendent relationships between species

</ul>

<p>
The discovery of the primary mechanism of evolution was the work of two english naturalists
</p>
<ul>
<li>
darwin

<li>
alfred russel wallace

</ul>

<p>
The two made the same observations independently of one another, with darwin being inspired by his work in South america
</p>
<ul>
<li>
1858, wallace wrote darwin for advice then darwin published origin of species

</ul>


<p>
Variability - there is variation in all populations of organisms
</p>
<ul>
<li>
No two members of pop are identical

<li>
Age sex, inherited traits, lifestyle etc.

<li>
The idea that individuals are variable was novel, as early naturalists believed in 'perfect types'

</ul>

<p>
Heritability - Variation is inherited or at least some
discovery of genes -&gt; discovery of dna
heritable traits are coded in DNA with genes carrying different alleles
</p>
<ul>
<li>
dominant 
	  Recessive

</ul>
	  
<p>
Different combinations of alleles result in different genotypes, and the physical expression of these genotypes results in a phenotype
</p>

<p>
Mutations - new variations in inheritable traits caused by miscopied DNA
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Some are harmful, some neutral, and others are beneficial

</ul>


<p>
Superfecundity - Organisms produce more offspring than can survive 
	reproductive excess
</p>
	
	
<p>
Natural selection is the mechanism by which organisms change
analogous to artificial selection selection/domestication
</p>

<p>
Natural selection was defined by:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Variability

<li>
Heritability

<li>
Superfecundity

</ul>
<li>
Therefore if some variation gives an individual organism an advantage for survival, and if they pass that on to offspring, then there is a better chance that organism will survive


<p>
Natural Selection is the variable and/or differential survival and subsequent reproduction of organisms in a population resulting in an overall change in phenotype in descendent
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Take home message:

<ul>
<li>
does not happen to individuals, but to populations

<li>
Similar to artificial selection, minus the being kept alive and deep geologic time part

<li>
Does not require simple organisms evolving to be more complicated

<li>
Cannot evolve toward something no 'end goal' favors what helps survival

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
Evolution explains:
	homologies - shared ancestry between a pair of structures or genes in different taxa
		opposite of this is homoplasy which are independant characters
	Structures adapt to different purposes as result of decent with modification
</p>
	
<p>
	Adaptations
		specialized features of animals and plants that perform one or more useful functions
		Allow that organism to excel in its environment
</p>

<p>
Hierarchy - Life is a tree of relation with descendants branching from common ancestors
</p>

<p>
<span id="-Vestigial Organs"></span><strong id="Vestigial Organs">Vestigial Organs</strong> - traits that have lost all or most of their original function through evolution
</p>
<ul>
<li>
may also retain lesser functions to develop a new, more minor function

</ul>

<p>
Common ancestors - Fossil record of groups intermediate between distinct modern groups represent common ancestors
</p>
<ul>
<li>
An example of evolutionary trends in groups

<li>
New species are the modified descendants of older species

<li>
Principle of fossil succession works because earth has a single non-repeating history

</ul>


<p>
âˆ´ evolution has five components:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Descent with modification

<li>
Modifications occur slowly over time

<li>
Populations may diverge into two or more separate lineages

<li>
All species share a common ancestor

<li>
Much of the evolutionary change present in populations due to natural selection

</ul>

<p>
Species change both microevolutionary scale and macroevolutionary scale
</p>

<p>
These changes are demonstrated through concepts of divergence and common ancestry
</p>

<p>
Adaptations
</p>
<ul>
<li>

<li>
Allow that organism to excel in its environment

</ul>
<li>
Hierarchy - Life is a tree of relatedness, with descendants branching out from common ancestors

<li>
Vestigial Organs - Traits that have lost all or most of their original function through evolution

<ul>
<li>

</ul>

<p>
Common ancestors - Fossil record of groups  intermediate between distinct modern groups represent common ancestors
</p>

<p>
	example of 'evolutionary trends' in groups
	New species are the modified descendants of older species
	Principle of fossil succession works because earth has a single non-repeating history
</p>
	

<p>
Species have micro and macro evolutionary changes
demonstrated through concepts of:
	divergence
	Common Ancestry
</p>
	
<p>
Common ancestry A group of organisms shares a common ancestor
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Closely related species are close because their common ancestor diverged relatively recently in earths history

<li>
Other species  are more distant because their ancestors diverge at a further (back) point in time

<li>
Complex patterns of common ancestry and descendants

</ul>

<p>
Divergent evolution - the accumulation of difference between groups, leading to the formation of a new species
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Two (or more) distinct variations in an ancestral population have their own advantages in geologic time

<li>
over time, these differences will become more pronounced

<li>
If they diverge enough, they will no longer be able to mate with one another

</ul>

<p>
Taxonomy - A named group of organisms
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Traditionally, each culture had its own name for the animals, plants and other organisms in their own region

<li>
linnaeus made universal set ofrules in 1758 to rank organisms

<li>
standardized organism naming and created a framework to compare relatedness

<li>
Linnean Rules:

<ul>
<li>
All names in latin/greek, modified to fit in latin form

<li>
Each name unique

<li>
nested hierarchy(species,genera,family,order,etc)

<li>
traditional official ranks:

<ul>
<li>
primary unit is species

<li>
net unit is genus which is &gt;1 species

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Species - Naturally ocurring populations that interbreed and produce viable offspring

<li>
Problem in fossil record - cannot test interbreeding/behaviors

<li>
The question therefore becomes, how different do two individuals or populations have to be for them to be different species?

</ul>
	
<p>
	Variations:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Sexual dimorphism - Different sexes are different sizes and shapes, have different structures that make them distinct from one another

<li>
Ontogeny (growth) - babies look different from juveniles which look different from subadults and adults:

<ul>
<li>
metamorphisms is extreme ontogeny

</ul>
<li>
Geography - populations in different regions might hhave different sizes, colors, patterns behaviors

<li>
Stratigraphy - Lineages may change some characteristics over time

<li>
Individuals one of the great discoveries by darwin/wallace was recognition that no two indiv. in population are identical

</ul>

<p>
species are not easily defined
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Stratigraphy - Lineages may change some characteristics over time
</p>

<p>
The fact that species aren't easily defined is one of the main clues to disovering evolution
</p>

<p>
In order to understand how organisms are related, we work 'outwards' from species to understand the larger picture, consider:
	common ancestry
	divergence
</p>
	
<p>
Systematics and phylogeny
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Systematics - A method of organizing organisms

<ul>
<li>
different from taxonomy, in that it seek to determine how organisms are related to one another

</ul>
<li>
Phylogeny - the evolutionary history of an organism

<ul>
<li>
reflection of patterns of ancestors and descendants,
		as all living things come from a common origin, therefore possible to reconstruct

<li>
From this cladistics was born

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
Cladistics - a method of classification of animals and plants according to the proportion of measurable characteristics that they have in common
</p>
<ul>
<li>
it was recognized that finding fossils which are direct ancestor of any species would be difficult

<li>
Instead, the focus shifted towards the distribution of derived characters (evolutionary specializations)

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
In cladistics not all traits are considered useful in figuring out evolutionary relationships

<ul>
<li>
Primitive (ancestral) traits do not help

<li>
Derived (unique) character states are how relatedness is determined

<li>
Convergent characters can be misleading

<ul>
<li>
as are reversal states

</ul>
<li>
Shared characterists is how we construct patterns of common ancestry

</ul>
</ul>
