Competitive]]]] firm Revenue + profit
</p>

<p>
Total revenue(TR) = price of good * quantity of good sold P*Q
	avg revenue - how much revenue firm receives for typical unit sold
		total rev/ quantity=P
	Marg revenue - change in total revenue from sale of each additional unit of output
	firm will shut down if total revenue &lt; variable costs  (still has to pay fixed costs)
</p>
<ul>
<li>
shutdown if TR&lt;VC

<li>
if TR/Q&lt;VC/Q
	avg revenue = price
	shutdown if P&lt;AVC

</ul>
	
<p>
	. firm must compare price it receives for typical unit with avc it incurs from typical unit
</p>
	
<p>
	firm will exit the market if revenue &lt; total cost
		&gt; exit if TR&lt; TC
		&gt; exit if TR/Q &lt; TC/Q
		&gt; exit if avg rev &lt; ATC
</p>
		
<p>
		avg rev = price
		exit if P&lt; ATC
		note: firm will enter market if P&gt; ATC
		aka if price of good is less than efficient scale: level of output that minimizes ATC 
</p>
		
<p>
meaning Profit in competitive Firm Graph: (same for monopoly
Profit= TR - TC
Profit=(TR/Q - TC/Q) * Q
Profit  = avg revenue - ATC
AR = price
</p>

<p>
Profit = P - ATC           * Q
</p>

<p>
Competitive Market Supply Curve:
	-short run = # of firms is fixed
</p>
<ul>
<li>
market supply curve is found by adding up outputs from each firm

<li>
long run = # of firms fluctuate based on who is entering/exiting market

<li>
after all entry + exit , firms that remain in the market must be making 0 economic profit

<li>
b/c profit = (P-ATC) * Q, entry + exit stops when price =ATC

<li>
competitive firms produce so that price = marginal cost(Q max) and sinc price must equal ATC, then

<li>
marginal cost = ATC Firms in long-run equilibrium must be operating at efficient scale.

</ul>
<p>
TL;DR eventually, # firms in the market adjusts so that price of good=mininum of ATC, and there one enough firms to satisfy demand at this price
