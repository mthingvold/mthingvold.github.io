<p>
Eight large plates
	several small plates
	not all plates move at the same rate or in the same way
</p>
	
<p>
	normal faults, reverse faults and slip faults
	reverse faults are compressional
	strike-slip faults are shearing (sliding past)
</p>
	
<p>
	Divergent boundary - two plates move apart, resulting in upwelling of material from the mantle to create new seafloor
		occurs at mid-ocean ridges can occur under continents t rift valleys
</p>
		
<p>
	Mid Ocean ridges
</p>
<ul>
<li>
site of crustal formation
	Convergent boundaries

<li>
two plates move together

<li>
process results in subduction

<li>
process takes place at conv. boundaries where one plate moves under another and sinks into the mantle due to gravity
	Oceanic ridges

<li>
spreading occurs along the oceanic ridge system

<li>
rates can account for all of earth's ocean basins within last 200 my

</ul>
