A dispenser is an ADT that is a collection of data that has current item
The current item is always determined by data structure and cannot be changed by the user:
	e.g.
		Stacks
		Queues
		Heaps
</p>
		
<p>
Heaps are a special type of binary tree which are well suited to the arrayed tree implementation
</p>

<p>
Stacks and queues are considered dispensers because they each have a "current item" (first and last respectively)
</p>

<p>
A heap is considered a dispenser because the current item is always in the root node of the heap.
</p>

<p>
in all cases current item is determined by data structure and not by the user. usuing pop,push,enqueue will change the cursors but it's through the implementation.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
dispenser is collection

<li>
dispenser has current item determined by dispenser

<li>
Current item cannot be changed by user(arbitrarily)

<li>
Current item can only be modified by dispenser operation

</ul>

<p>
A heap has the heap property:
	the item stored at a node must be at least as large as any of its descendents (if any).
</p>
	
<p>
	In a heap when an item is removed it's always the largest(root) that gets removed
	Only Item that is allowed to be inspected is the top of the heap.
</p>
	
	
<p>
Heaps have two esential operations
	insert() - adds an item to the heap
	delete() - remove the item from the top of the heap
</p>
	
<p>
Neither operation is trivial. inserting involves holding true to heap property, deleting involves rearranging  the remaining items
