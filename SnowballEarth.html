<ul>
<li>
Low latitude glaciation driven by a runaway ice-albedo feed-back

<li>
Two main episodes: 750 Ma and 600 Ma

<li>
GCM's show that there is a critical level of CO₂ in the atmosphere below which the snowball is inevitable

<li>
what caused the draw-down in atm. CO₂ that initiated the runaway glaciation?

<ol>
<li>
Organic carbon burial on newly created continental shelves?

<li>
Enhanced silicate weathering?

</ol>
</ul>

<p>
Silicate weathering trigger
Equatorial position and formation and break-up of a supercontinent
</p>
<ul>
<li>
neoproterozoic era (544-900 Ma)

</ul>

<p>
Habitable zone (HZ)
</p>
<ul>
<li>
inner edge of HZ is 0.95 AU, which is 1.11 times present solar luminosity. This is where water begins to be lost by photodissociation

<li>
Outer edge is around 1.5 AU However, in some climate models moving earth outwards by 1.01 AU is enough to cause runaway global glaciations!

</ul>


<ul>
<li>
The sun is getting brighter on the main sequence (1%/100Ma)

<li>
Eventually the sun will grow intto a bloated red giant reaching the orbit of venus. Luminocity will increases 1000-fold and the earth will be fried!

</ul>

<p>
Venus has an atmospheric pressure of 92 bars CO₂. This is enough to heat the surface 460 degree C from a runaway greenhouse effect.
