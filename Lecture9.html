Difference Quotients
eg suppose a=x^2 b=5x c=7
Find (a-b)/c 	(x^2-5x)/7
</p>

<p>
suppose f(x) =x^2 +7
find (f(x+h)-f(x))/h
</p>

<p>
f(x+h)=(x+h)<sup><small>2 + 7 = x</small></sup>2+2xh+h<sup><small>2=7		h=h	(f(x+h)-f(x))/h = (x</small></sup>2+2xh+4<sup><small>2+7-(x</small></sup>2+7))/h cancel x^2,and 7 factor out h on top
h(2x+h)/h= <span id="-2x+h"></span><strong id="2x+h">2x+h</strong>

<p>
Everything learned has been review calculus starts here
at the heart of calculus is a new concept the limit of  a function
</p>

<p>
lim f(x)
x-&gt;a
</p>

<p>
asks the question: "What is the limit of f(x) as x approaches a?
</p>

<p>
"x approaches a" means that we must consider a progression of numbers getting closer and closer to the number a e.g If a= 5 then consider x=4.5, x=4.9 x=4.9999
a series of numbers that get closer without actually getting there.
</p>

<p>
x-&gt; a^- means x approaches a from the left
x-&gt;a^+ means x approaches a from the right 		x never touches a
</p>

<p>
x-&gt;a means x is approaching a but from both sides
</p>

<p>
lim f(x) asks "as x takes values
x-&gt;a
closer and closer to the number a, does f(x) also get closer to the number L
if yes then we say that the limit exists and limx-&gt;a f(x) = L
if no then we say that the limit does not exist
</p>

<p>
Initially we have two options when calculating a limit:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
make a table of values if the function is given as a formula

<li>
Trace along the graph if the function is given pictorially
	(he'll give a better step-by-step procedure shortly)

</ol>
	
<p>
	lim(x^2+3x) x-&gt;2
</p>
	
<p>
	x= f(x)=x^2+3x
	1.5 6.75
	1.9 9.31
	1.99 9.9301
	1.999 9.99
</p>
	
<p>
	2.5 13.75
	2.1 10.71
	2.00001 10.00007

	lim(x^2+3x=10) x-&gt;2

	find lim(1/x^2)  x-&gt;0

</p>
	
<p>
	therfrome lim1/x^2=inf x-&gt;0
</p>
	
<p>
	eg find
	lim f(x) if f(x) = {x+2 if x&lt;=1
		x-&gt;1	   { -x if x&gt;1
</p>
	
<p>
	x		f(x)=x+2
	0.5		2.5
	0.9		2.9
	0.99		2.99
		y-&gt;3^-  f(x)=-x
	1.5		-.1.5
	1.1		-1.1
	1.01		-1.01
		y-&gt;-1^-
</p>
		
<p>
		3!=-1 therfore lim f(x) does not exist

<div id="Procedure to find the limit of a function lim f(x) x-&gt;a"><h1 id="Procedure to find the limit of a function lim f(x) x-&gt;a" class="justcenter">Procedure to find the limit of a function lim f(x) x-&gt;a</h1></div>
	
<p>
	Try calculating f(a)
</p>
<ol>
<li>
if f(a) is a real number ( and a is not an endpoint of the domain of f(x) or a transition point of a piecewise function), then limf(x)=f(a)
		if a is an endpoint of your domain then lim f(x) does not exist but one of the two one sided limits will exist and be equal to f(a)
		lim x<sup><small>3-2x</small></sup>2+5 x-&gt;3	3<sup><small>2-2(3)</small></sup>2+5=14 is x=3 an endpoint of the domain? Domain: |R limit x-&gt;3 of  =14
			find lim sqrt(x-4) x-&gt;4 find f(4) = sqrt0 =0 is x=4 an endpoint? even root: x-4&gt;=0 x&gt;=4 -&gt; [4,inf)yes it is an endpoint therefore the limit of x-&gt;4 of sqrt(x-4) doesn't exit but x-&gt;4^+ sqrt(x-4) = 0
			find lim12 x-&gt;-5 find f(-5) =12  Domain |R therefore lim12=12 x-&gt;-5

</ol>
			
<ol>
<li>
If evalutating f(a) results in a non-zero number divided by zero, then you have found a vertical asymptote of your function: a vertical line x=a that the
	   graph of f(x) gets closer and closer to but never touches this leaves three possibilites:
	   	limf(x)=inf x-&gt;a or limf(x)=-inf x-&gt;a or lim f(x) does not exist x-&gt;a
		goes up			goes down			goes up and down diagnolly so quad one and 3 or 2 and 4 asymptote

</ol>
		
<p>
		to figure out which of these is true, we pick a couple of inputs just bigger than and just smaller than a and look at the corresponding outputs
</p>
		
<p>
		EG find lim(1/(x-3)) x-&gt;3 f(3)=1/(3-3) = 1/0 SO x=3 is a vertical asymptote for this function.
		plus m, e.g, x=3.01 and x=2.99
		f(3.01)=1/(3.01-3)=100 x-&gt;3^+ 1/(x-3) = inf
		lim 1/(x-3)^- = -inf so lim 1/(x-3) x-&gt;3
