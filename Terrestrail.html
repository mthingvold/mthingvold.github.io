<p>
Lacustrine (lakes) - An area filled with water in a localized basin that is surrounded by land.
	lower elevation more likely preservation
</p>
	
<ul>
<li>
Sediments

<ul>
<li>
Coarsets around lake margin

<li>
Finest at center (often layered

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Two types of lakes based on hydrology:

<ul>
<li>
Open Lakes:

<ul>
<li>
Have an outlet

<li>
Stable shorelines

<li>
Freshwater

</ul>
<li>
Closed Lakes:

<ul>
<li>
No outlet

<li>
fluctuating shorelines

<li>
Often hypersaline\

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
<span id="-Desert"></span><strong id="Desert">Desert</strong> - Landscape or region of land that is very dry due to low rainfall.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Often has little coverage by plants.

<li>
Steams dry up seasonally unless supplied by an outside area

<li>
More water lost due to evaporation

<li>
Soil has little organic matter

<li>
Soil is made up of evaporite minerals and eolian sand dunes

<li>
Precipitation does not leave the basin

<li>
Playa lakes are temporary lakes that are associated with evaporates

<li>
Steambeds are ephemeral and usually only run during heavy rainfall

<li>
normally &gt;4 inches of rain/year

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Practically all steambeds are dry most of the time and are ephemeral:

<ul>
<li>
Carry water only during rainfall

<li>
Rain can be heavy and not all of it may soak into the ground

</ul>
<li>
Desert vegatitive cover is sparse, runoff is largely unhindered and flash floods are common:

<ul>
<li>
Streams lack extensive system of tributaries

<li>
Streams are small; die before reaching the sea

</ul>
</ul>
	
	
<ul>
<li>
Dunes

<ul>
<li>
Piles of sand moved downwind by wind direction

<li>
Forms through cross-bedding

</ul>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>
Low-latitiue deserts:

<ul>
<li>
Subtropics - dry climate

<li>
Due to global distribution of air pressure and winds

<li>
Vicinity of the tropics of cancer and capricorn

</ul>
<li>
Mid-Latitude deserts

<ul>
<li>
Located in the deep interiors of continents

<li>
High mountains in the path of the prevailing winds produce a rainshadow desert

<li>
precipitation only 10-20 cm/yr

</ul>
</ul>
		
<ul>
<li>
Polar deserts

<ul>
<li>
Many Polar regions are technically deserts because they receive little precipitation

<li>
precipitation only 10-20 cm

<li>
much of canada's arctic is polar desert

</ul>
<li>

<ul>
<li>
Indicate cold climates

<li>
Have varied in frequency throughout earths history

<li>
Results in massive erosion and transport of sediment

<p>
Transgression - A rise in relative sea level resultign in her shoreline moving inland towards the continents
</p>

<p>
Regression - fall in relative sea level, results in basinward migration of the shoreline
</p>


<p>
What happens when a river enters an ocean?
You get one of two things: Delta or Estuary
</p>

<p>
Transgression - A rise in relative sea level, resulting in the shoreline moving inland, towards the coninent.
Regression - A fall in relative sea level, resulting in a basinward (seaward) migration of the shoreline
</p>

<p>

<ul>
<li>
A prism of sediment that forms where a river enters a marine environments:

<ul>
<li>
Mixture of marine and fluvial influences and are constructive

</ul>
<li>
Abrupt decrease in energy causes river to quickly drop its sediment load

Commonly in shallow, tropical waters where siliciclastic sediments are rare

<li>
Reefs are a prominent feature in nearshore environments, and in the geologic record form fossiliferous limestones
