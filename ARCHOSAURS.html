<p>
Archosaurs
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Archosaurs – a group of diapsid amniotes whose living representatives consist of non – avian dinosaurs, crocodiles, and birds

<li>
Are defined by having an extra opening between the eye socket and the nostril, possibly holding soft tissue associated with cooling the face and breathing

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Can be divided into two main groups;

<ul>
<li>
Pseudosuchia – crocodilians and everything more closely related to crocodilians than to birds

<li>
Ornithodira – birds and non-avian dinosaurs

<li>
Sister group is the Phytosaurs, a group of crocodile-like reptiles

</ul>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>
Archosaurs are classified into the two main groups of Pseudosuchia and Ornithodira based on their ankle joints

<li>
The Pseudosuchia retained an ankle structure found in earlier reptiles

<li>
The Ornithodira have ankles like birds, allowing them to move their ankle in a single plane, like a hinge

<li>
This was more suitable for running

<li>
Early Archosaurs had a sprawling gait, due to the placement of their ankles and hips

<li>
As time went on, Archosaurs began to evolve past this

</ul>


<ul>
<li>
The pseudosuchia dominated mid-late triassic

<li>
Radiated into a number of forms:

<ul>
<li>
armored spiky herbivores

<li>
Herbivorous quadrupeds

<li>
toothless bipeds

<li>
Terrestrial carnivours

<li>
Fast-running quadrupeds:

<ul>
<li>
oddly enough, this line produces the crocodilian lineage

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
The Pseudosuchians include some of the first terrestrial animals to exceed the size of hippos

</ul>

<div id="Ornithodira"><h3 id="Ornithodira">Ornithodira</h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
The Ornithodira appear in the fossil record in the mid Tri but there are footprints that suggest they evolved in the early triassic

<li>
More lightly built than pseudosuchians, and most were originally bipedal

<li>
This group is made up of the first proto - dinosaurs, true dinosaurs, and their closest relatives:

<ul>
<li>
together, they are known as the dinosauromorphs

<li>
Defined on the basis of their hindlimbs:

<ul>
<li>
erect posture

<li>
hinge like ankles and digitigrade posture

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Locomotion"><h3 id="Locomotion">Locomotion</h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
in the mid Triassic, some archosaurs developed hip joints that required them to have a more erect gait:

<ul>
<li>
this allowed them to have greater stamina due to evolving beyond Carrier's constraint

<li>
Carrier's constraint - air breathing vertebrates which have two lungs and flex their bodies sideways during locomotion find it difficult to breath at the same time:

<ul>
<li>
This means archosaurs could runk and breath at the same time

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
An upright stance requires more energy and is therefore metabolically expensive

</ul>

<div id="Metabolism"><h3 id="Metabolism">Metabolism</h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
Archosaurs metabolism is a topic of intense interest:

<ul>
<li>
how can archosaurs maintain a posture and lifestyle that is metabolically expensive?

<li>
We can look to Crocodiles to provide some of these answers

</ul>
<li>
4 - Chambered Heart:

<ul>
<li>
Both mammals and birds have a 4-chambered heart, which completely separates the flow of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood:

<ul>
<li>
reptiles have a 3 chambered heart

</ul>
<li>
Modern crocodiles have a 4 chambered heart, and a pulmonary bypass

</ul>
<li>
Secondary palate:

<ul>
<li>
An anatomical structure that divides the nasal cavity from the oral cavity

<li>
This allows an animal to eat and breath at the same time

<li>
Also protects their brain from struggling prey

</ul>
<li>
Hepatic Piston

<ul>
<li>
Archosaurs had a muscular diaphragm for breathing, much like mammals have

<li>
Different in that it connects to the front of the pelvis, which pulls the liver down so the lungs can expand

<li>
Air flows unidirectional through the lungs

</ul>
<li>
All of these features combined suggest that Archosaurs were actually warm-blooded

<li>
Then why are crocodiles ectothermic?

<ul>
<li>
The anatomical evidence shows that crocodiles were originally warm blooded, but reverted back to a cold-blooded lifestyle when it became an aquatic ambush predator

<li>
The earliest crocodilians were slim, leggy terrestrial predators. Some were even bipedal.

<li>
Erect limbs are beneficial for active predators, and crocodiles do retain this to a degree

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Waste Removal"><h3 id="Waste Removal">Waste Removal</h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
Therapsids were still around during the Triassic, were well established and were the dominant terrestrial organisms, so why did they disappear?

<li>
Partly, this is due to waste removal, and how these groups excrete ammonia:

<ul>
<li>
Ammonia is a byproduct of metabolism, and is created through amino acid breakdown and is toxic in high amounts

<li>
In reptiles and birds, uric acid is excreted in the feces as a dry waste

<li>
In Synapdis, therapsids and mammals, it is excreted as urea as a wet waste

</ul>
<li>
Due to paleoclimate and geography the fact the archosaurs don't pee and have aglandulous favoured their success over early mammals

</ul>


<ul>
<li>
As the dinosauromorphs diverged from earlierarchosaurs, their erect stance, hinged ankle, and digitigrade walking style allowed them to outcompete everything else at the time

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Also allowed them to become very large

<li>
The first true dinosaur fossils appear around 228million years ago in the Late Triassic 
  then dinos evolve into many differeent groups

</ul>
