<p>
Physical geology - studies earth materials; seeks to understand processes that operate on and beneath its surface
</p>

<p>
historical geology - seeks to understand origin of earth
uses geo principles to reconstruct earth history and life.
Combines many subdisciplines of geology:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
sedimentology

<li>
stratigraphy

<li>
plate tectonics and paleogeography

<li>
paleontology

</ul>

<p>
<span id="-Key Concepts"></span><strong id="Key Concepts">Key Concepts</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
the surface of the earth, position of continents, environments and organisms have changed a lot.

<li>
Rocks that make up the lithosphere record these changes

</ul>

<p>
History of geological history
PreSci:
	Origin of earth seperated from natural disasters
	A singular event
"Deep Time"
	Geologic time is far more vast than time scales familiar to most people
	Ancient history involves thinking in hundreds or thousands of years, geologic time is in mill/bill
	Two different types of time:
		relative
		absolute
Geologic Time Scale
	Developed using
		biostratigraphy
		radioactive decay
	Divided into 
		Phanerozoic
		Precambrian/Archean
	Cambrian
		Oldest rocks with conspicuous fossils
Foundations of geology
	Principle of uniformatism
		There are inviolable laws of nature that have not yet changed in the course of time
		First founding principle of geology
	Actualism
		Application of modern processes to ancient system
	Catastrophism

Materials and Processes
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Rock

<ul>
<li>
interlocking or bonded grains of matter typically composed of single minerals

</ul>
<li>
Mineral

<ul>
<li>
Naturality occurring inorganic solid element or compound with chem comp or range of comps and a specific internal structure

</ul>
<li>
Outcrop/Exposure

<ul>
<li>
Rocky surfaces that stand exposeod and are readily accessible for study.

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
Nebular hypothesis - bodies in solar system evolved from solar nebula
</p>
<ul>
<li>
stars form in a massive and dense cloud of molecular hydrogen, which coalesces and collapses, forming a star

<li>
Produces a gaseous protoplanetary disk around the star.

<li>
Initially very hot, the disk cools and dust grains made of rock and ice coagulate

<li>
birth of gaseous planets thought to be due to forminng far enough away form the sun that early planets are ice

</ul>
