<p>
the mind body problem, unsermountable gap between two distinct kinds of entities: mind and body.
two points in the sixth meditation:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
The distinction between body and mind

<li>
The union of body and mind

</ol>
<p>
two models of the mind:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
The mind as a receptacle:
		The mind is the entity in which all cognitive activity occurs.

<li>
the mind as an activity:

<ol>
<li>
the mind is nothing but cognittive activity.

</ol>
</ol>
<p>
two interpretations of descartes' distinction:
	1/ two diff substances(eg chair and table)
	2/ two KInds of substances: two ways of defining what a substance is.
objection: argument from ignorance
	formal definition: the absence of proof is not the proof of absence
</p>

<p>
four possible assessments of a given proposition:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
prop is true

<li>
prop is false

<li>
you don't know if it's true or false

<li>
whether it's true or not is unknowable.

</ol>

<p>
two ways of using an argument from ignorance
1/ if a prop has not been proven fale then it cannot be false Leap; therefore it must be true
2/ if a prop has not been proven true then it cannot be true Leap; therefore it must be false
</p>

<p>
the point of the objection;
	From the fact that i don't yet conceive clearly and distinctly that
	mind and body
	they are united i cannot distinctly infer that they aren't.
</p>
	
	
<p>
The problem of induction: 
whatr is the nature of our reasonings concerning matters of fact?
</p>

<p>
certainty in experience:
	a function of the regularity of our experience
'proof' in this case:
	infallible experience of the regularity of events
probability:
	contrariety of evidence concerning the regularity of events(fallible experience)
Hume's cliam(p.111)
</p>

<p>
principle of inductive inference:
	all inferences concerning matters of fact are based onour experience of the regularity of events.
As applied to question of testimony:
	all inferences concerning testimonies are based on our experience of conformity between testimonies and matters of fact.
qhat forms the core of our experience of testimony?
Three constant observations:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
People have memory and they rely on it.

<li>
People have an inclination to tell the truth

<li>
people lie, but fear being caught.

</ol>
<p>
Contrarity of evidence:
In the case of experience in general, it stems from opposing observations.
in the case of testimony, it stems from various factors:
	1-From opposing testimonies
	2- Number of witnesses
	3- the character of the witnesses
	4 - delivery of the testimony
