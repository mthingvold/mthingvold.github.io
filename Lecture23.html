Application #2:
Maximizing area/enclosure
eg A farmer has 600 feet of fence and wants to build an animal pen with three equal compartments for lions tigers and bees
What is the largest area such an enclosure can contain
</p>

<p>
A=3x*y
600 =6x+4y
isolate for y and sub into the a formula
4y=600-6x
y=(600-6x)/4
A= 3x ((600-5x)/4) = 1800x-18x^2  /4
a=1800/4x - (18/4)x<sup><small>2 = 450x-9/2x</small></sup>2= A^^=x=50
this is the "location" NOTE
</p>

<p>
y=600-6(50)  / 4 = 600-300/4 = 75 	put 50 into x
</p>

<p>
 the dimensions are 50 by 75 feet
</p>
 
<p>
 application #3: max volume
Eg a sheet of metal is a square 8 inches long on each side. An open top box can be created from this sheet bycutting identical squares from each corner folding the flaps up and welding them together.
what's the box of max volume that can be made in this way?
</p>

<p>
find V find V^^
</p>

<p>
V=l*w*h
=(8-2x)(8-2x)*x
V=x(8-2x)^2
Note:Because x is a length, the smallest x can be is zero
what is the biggest x can be?
x=4 is the biggest
</p>

<p>
So, find max for [0,4]
-&gt; can use EVT
v^<sup><small>=(x)</small></sup><sup><small> * (8-2x)</small></sup>2+x*[(8-2x)<sup><small>2]</small></sup>^
=(8-2x)^2-4x(8-2x)= 0
(8-2x)[(8-2x)-4x]=0
(8-2x)(8-6x)=0
8=2x  8=6x
x=4   x=4/3
V=x(8-2x)^2
</p>

<p>
x	V
0	0	
4/3	1024/27 ABS MAX
4	0
		the absolute max vol of 1024/27 inches^3 is when we cut 4/3 of an inch squares for each corner.

3.4 Further app of optimization
Maxing profit again
sometimes the variable in our profit equation represents quantity
Other times, it represents something else. We will have to adapt the formulas we learned before to acommodate these other scenarios
For example, the variable could represent the number of price increases or decreases:
If we increase the price of a good clearly p gets bigger. It is also likely that the quantity sold will get smaller.
</p>

<p>
eg R=p*x
p(n)*x(n)
where n = number of price reductions
the band <span id="-Derivative Nonsesne"></span><strong id="Derivative Nonsesne">Derivative Nonsesne</strong> is selling CDs at their concert. When disks cost 10\(, 60 people will buy them. For each \)1 decrease in price, 20 more people will buy a disk. Manufacturing costs are 3\( per CD and fixed cost of 100\)
</p>

<p>
maximiz3e profti
P-&gt; P^^=0
R=p*x
C=vx+k
P=R-[C]
let n= number of 1$ price reductions
</p>

<p>
R=price per disk * number of disks sold
</p>

<p>
  (10-1*n)*(60+20n)
  C=3x+100 x is not our variable in this problem
  R=(10-n)(60+20n)
  R=600+200n-60n-20n^2
   = 600+140n-20n^2
  c=280+60n
  P=R-[C]
  P=600+140n-20^2 - [280+60n]
  P=320+80n-20n^2
  P^^=80-40n=0		-40n=-8	n=2
  What price and what profit? The hand should charge 10-n=10-2=8$ per disk.
  At this price profit=
  P=320+80(8)-20(8)^2=-320$XXX put n=2 not n=8
  p=320+80(2)-20(2)^2=400$ profit
