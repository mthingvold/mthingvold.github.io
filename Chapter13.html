profit=Total revenue - total cost
</p>
<ul>
<li>
econ proffit - total revenue - explicit + implicit costs

<li>
accounting profit - total explicit costs only

</ul>
<p>
tech efficiency - can't increase out put w/o increasing input
econ efficieny - cost of production for output is as low as possible
production function: Q=g(know-how) (L(labour),K(capital),N(Nat resources))
short run- at least 1 variable fixed usually capital
</p>

<p>
Q=g(L,K)
long run - all factars are var
</p>
<ul>
<li>
firm tries to max output but contained by cost of factors of production

<li>
C(cost restr) = P(labor price)L(labor)+Pk K capital

</ul>

<p>
Total cost = TFC + TVC
</p>

<p>
ATC avg total cost = TC/Q(qty out) 
AFC=TFC/Q
AVC=TVC/Q
MC=TC/Q
marg product = additional output produced per unit of that input hired
</p>

<p>
MC slopes upwards b/c diminishing marg product
ATC ushaped b/c reflects both avc and afc
mc &lt; atc, atc down
mc &gt; atc, atc up
avc gets closer to ATC bc avg fixed cost down as out increases
