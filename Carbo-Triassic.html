<p>
The Carboniferous spans 60 Ma from 359 Ma to 298 Ma (start of permian)
</p>

<p>
US split Mississipian, Pennsylvanian

<p>
Tabulata-stromatoporoid reef complexes disappear:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
THis is related to mid-ocean ridge activity, and the seas switching from being high in calcite, to being high in aragonite:

<ul>
<li>
Mid ocean ridge activity high results in high levels of Mg to Ca therfore aragonite seas and little reef building

</ul>
<li>
Therrefore, there is no substantial reef complexes during the carboniferous

</ul>

<p>
Continued decline in CO₂
</p>
<ul>
<li>
put into soils, coals

<li>
lowers greenhouse effect starts new series of glaciation

</ul>

<p>
time of significant mountain building, as super continent pangea is formed at end of carbo
</p>

<p>
major drop in sea level mid carbo.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Casuses worldwide regression

<li>
seperates mississipian from pensylvanian

<li>
Decline of CO2 with oxygen levels reaching maximum in earth history

<li>
forst fire commonality extreme

<li>
30-35% oxygen

</ul>
<p>
Cyclotherms - alternating stratigraphic sequences of marine and non-marine sediments
</p>
<ul>
<li>
interbedded coal seams

<li>
in carbo. are formed by reg. trans. cycles

</ul>
<p>
Cover large expanses of NA,Europe, RUssia, china
	vast majority of the worlds coal deposits
	removed lots of CO2 and sunk into coal
</p>
	
<p>
Industrial rev. powered by coal, Roar more CO2
Coal dep. to this extent has never been repeated
</p>

<p>
Many groups never recover after late devonian extinction:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Tabulata corals

<li>
Stromatoporoids

<li>
Trilobites

<li>
Placoderms

</ul>
<p>
Creates room for more big bois to flourish
</p>
<ul>
<li>
crinoids, blastoids

<li>
Bryozoans brachiopods, ammonites, sharks and fish

</ul>

<p>
Convergent evo. creates many diff types of trees among the vascular plants
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Scale Trees (arborescent lycods, trees of swampy lowlands)

<li>
Calamites

<ul>
<li>
Arborescent spenopsids

<li>
Giant horsetails

<li>
Cycads

<ul>

Seed plants

</ul>
<li>
Conifers

<ul>
<li>
Cone bearing seed plants
	Arthopods diversify on land (divers. of land plants)
	Insects winged hexapods

</ul>
<li>
Early insects fixed wings (dragonflies)

<li>
late carbo foldable wings

<li>
Advanced metamorphism appears (maggots, caterpillars, nymphs)

<li>
Gigantic forms appear(high oxygen) (remember those big fucken bugs in ark, yeah)

</ul>
<li>
Romers Gap - few stegocephalians are known between late dev and mid- carb. (possible sampling issue maybe it's a real gap)

<li>
by late carb. there's many stegoceph. that became true tetrapods

<li>
most picivorous

<li>
Wide range in size, habitat

<li>
Return to water for eggs

<li>
Major eco. breakthrough in late Carboniferous:

<ul>
<li>
Amniotic egg

<li>
led to massive adaptive radiations

<li>
Amniotes become dominant group of large bodied terrestrial animals

<li>
Carb. rainforest collapse

<ul>
<li>
vast tropical rainforests suddenly collapse as the climate went hot to cold

<li>
devestating to forests and animals inhabiting (amphibians especially)

<li>
Leaves room for new upcoming group which would diversify and radiate

<li>
due to amniotic egg and dev. of scales to prevent dessication, reptiles become the dominant terrestrial organisms

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
	
<p>
	Paleography:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Tabulata-stromatoporoid reef complexes dissapear:

<ul>
<li>
Related to mid-ocean ridge activity, and the seas switching from being high in calcite, to being high in aragonite

<li>
Therefore there is no substantial reef complexes during the carboniferous

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
A continued decline CO₂:

<ul>
<li>
Being put into soils and coals

<li>
This lowers the greenhouse effect, and starts a new series of glaciation

</ul>
<li>
A time of significant mountain building as the super continent pangea is formed at the end of the carboniferous



<ul>
<li>
There is a major drop in sea level in the Mid-Carboniferous:

<ul>
<li>
Causes a worldwide regression

<li>
This is what is used to separate the Mississippian from the Pennsylvanian

</ul>
<li>
Continued decline of CO₂, with oxygen levels reaching their maximum in Earth history

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Tetrapods-Cyclotherms"></span><strong id="Cyclotherms">Cyclotherms</strong> - alternating stratigraphic sequences of marine and non-marine sediments:

<div id="Permian"><h3 id="Permian">Permian</h3></div>
<p>
	298Ma - 251 Ma (Triassic)
	After collapse of carboniferous rainforest ecosystem, vast deserts occupied much of the continental interior
</p>
<ul>
<li>
World was dominated by supercontinent Pangea

</ul>
<li>
Amniotes diversified during this time, leading to the ancestral groups of mammals, turtles, lepidosaurs and archosaurs


<ul>
<li>
During this time, all the Earths major landmasses were in <span id="Permian-Pangaea"></span><strong id="Pangaea">Pangaea</strong>

<li>
Deserts were widespread, with the interior of the continent experiencing extreme climate variation:

<ul>
<li>
highly seasonal, with monsoonal conditions dominating the coastlines

</ul>
<li>
Arid conditions favored gymnosperms over ferns and lycopods

<ul>
<li>
Plants with seeds enclosed in a protective cover over those that need water to complete their lifecycle

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Coal swamps decline throughout much of the world:

<ul>
<li>
China and high latitude regions are exceptions

</ul>
<li>
Glossopteris (of continental drift fame) was a seed fern that adapted to cold, dry environments

<li>
Conifers diversity

<li>
No New groups of arthropods appear during the permian

<ul>
<li>
Giant forms disappear, likely due to a decrease in oxygen

</ul>
<li>
Tetrapods four footed nibbas

<ul>
<li>
Name is restricted to amphibians and amniota and all descendants of their most recent common ancestor

</ul>
<li>
major ecological breakthrough breakthrough in the late carbo.:

<ul>
<li>
amniotic egg:

<ul>
<li>
Self continued egg with leathery shell, and tissues keep embryo moist, oxygenated and fed

</ul>
<li>
Led to massive adaptive radiations

<li>
Amniotes become dominant group of large bodied terrestrial animals

</ul>
<li>
Amniotes 2 groups:

<ul>
<li>
Synapsids - enlarged jaw muscle opening for increased chewing power

<li>
Sauropsids - better color vision and water retention

</ul>
<li>
Synapsids were first group to radiate during the early permian:

<ul>
<li>
Small headed, heavily built herbivores

<li>
Semi aquatic fish eaters

<li>
Sail-backed plant and/or mollusk eaters

<li>
Sail-backed carnivores

</ul>
<li>
early synapsids have sprawling stance found in more primitive tetrapods

<li>
Probably cold-blooded:

<ul>
<li>
Cold-bloocdedness is the ancestral state of vertebrates

</ul>
	
<ul>
<li>
Some evidence they had parental care

<li>
Traditionally, these animals were considered reptiles:

<ul>
<li>
They lack the shared derived characters of reptiles

<li>
Places in a separate group called the pelycosaurs, literally primitive synapsids

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
The early synapsids evolved themselves into extinction:

<ul>
<li>
were replaced in the middle-late permian by the therapsids

</ul>
<li>
Therapsida - advanced synapsids known informally as the 'mammal-like  reptiles':

<ul>
<li>
Greatly expanded infratemporal fenestra

<li>
Teeth divided into incisors, canines, and grinding back teeth

<li>
Forelimbs more powerfully developed than hind limbs

</ul>
<li>
Predators, herbivores and omnivores appeared

</ul>
<p>
<span id="Permian-Therapsids"></span><strong id="Therapsids">Therapsids</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Ancestrally all vertebrates are cold-blooded, however, some evidence suggests the therapsids may have had elevated metabolisms:

<ul>
<li>
This suggests they were at least partially warm-blooded

</ul>
<li>
Some of the evidence includes:

<ul>
<li>
A more upright stance than typical sprawling tetrapods

<li>
Some had a diaphragm, allowing for more effective breathing

<li>
Some had a secondary palate, allowing them to breath while feeding

<li>
Complex teeth for processing food more effectively

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Ectotherms - an animal that is dependent on external source for body heat:

<ul>
<li>
this is much less metabolically expensive, but it means that you are less active overall

<li>
Limits the kinds of environments or times of day and year when they can be active

</ul>
<li>
Endotherms - an animal that is dependent on, or capable of the internal generation of heat:

<ul>
<li>
This is due to mitochondria, and results in greater activity

<li>
Grow faster, quick recovery and live in  colder climates

<li>
Tradeoff is, you need to eat a lot more

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Relatively rare in the carb and permian

<li>
Characterized by a number features:

<ul>
<li>
aglandular skin - few sweat glands

<li>
Waterproof skin - keratin makes it resistant

<li>
Water conserving kidneys - waste released as urea

<li>
Excellent color vision - 4-5 types of color recptors

</ul>
<li>
These features would serve sauropsids well when the permo-triassic extinction hit

</ul>

<div id="Permo triassic mass extinction"><h3 id="Permo triassic mass extinction">Permo triassic mass extinction</h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
Largest mass extinction of all time, with 80-96 species surviving(4-20%)

<li>
Victims:

<ul>
<li>
Trilobites

<li>
Rugosa,tabulata

<li>
Graptolites

<li>
eurypterids

<li>
many brachiopods

<li>
blastoids

<li>
many primitive therapsids

</ul>
<li>
This extinction reorganized the world

<li>
After this, the paleozoic fauna becomes subordinate to the modern marine fauna

<li>
Size and diversity of animals present is greatly reduced

<li>
There are some observable patterns to the organisms that do survive:

</ul>

<p>
Marine Realm
</p>
<ul>
<li>
light calcifiers or non-calcifiers survive better

<li>
motile survive over sessile

<li>
organisms with protected respiration organs survive

<li>
Shifts the world to one dominated more by swimming and predation more than sessile

</ul>
<li>
Continental

<ul>
<li>
Survivors are adapted to low oxygen (burrowers, mountain dwellers, semi aquatic forms)

<li>
Favored those with sophisticated respiration or lower metabolic rates and small size

</ul>
