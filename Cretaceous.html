<div id="Cretaceous Besides dinosaurs"><h3 id="Cretaceous Besides dinosaurs">Cretaceous Besides dinosaurs</h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
lots of other stuff that happened besides radiation of birds/dinosuars

<li>
Pterosaurs, crocodilians, turtles, amphibians, and freshwater fish continue to diversify

<li>
The cretaceous Terrestrial revolution - diversification of herbaceous flowering plants, their pollinators, and small predators (lizards, snakes, mammals)

</ul>

<div id="Evolution of Angiosperms"><h3 id="Evolution of Angiosperms">Evolution of Angiosperms</h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
Before the cretaceous, the types of plants dominating the landscape were lycopods, cycads, different pine/spruce trees (gymnosperms), which rely on water or wind to disperse pollen/seeds

<li>
The flowering plants which are common today, did not show up until mid-late cretaceous

<li>
Angiosperm - A plant that has flowers and produces seeds encased within a fruit, produced from the flower.

<ul>
<li>
All plants that produce a flower are an angiosperm

</ul>
<li>
Flowering plants (angiosperms) May have appeared in jurassic, more important in cretaceous

<li>
basic angiosperm life cycle hinges on co-evolution with animals

<li>
Angiosperms developed an extraordinary mechanism for dispersing their seeds:

<ul>
<li>
believed angiosperms able to evolve so rapidly due to co-evolution with insect Pollinators

<li>
enables spread of genetic material over much larger area than other plants.

</ul>
<li>
Cretaceous angiosperms have fossil flowers that have features that are associated with insect pollination

<li>
basic angiosperm life cycle:

<ul>
<li>
Bright colors, attractive smells, interesting patterns on the flower attract pollinators (typically flying insects), move pollen to flower of other plants.

<li>
Fruit remains bitter, hard, dull colored until the seeds are mature enough to grow.

<ul>
<li>
At that point, fruit becomes brightly colored, fleshy, and sweet. Fruit eaten -&gt; deposited as dung

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Insect Radiation"><h3 id="Insect Radiation">Insect Radiation</h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
Corresponding with diversification of angiosperms, radiation of insects:

<ul>
<li>
for many groups, such as beetles (Coleoptera) and butterflies/moths (Lepidoptera) no coincidence

</ul>
<li>
First flies Dipteta appear in triassic

<li>
First wasps hymenoptera) appear in the jurassic and bees and ants in the cretaceous

<li>
Beetles (Coleoptera) roaches, mantids and termites (Blattaria) and most other appear in the cretaceous

</ul>


<p>
<span id="Insect Radiation-Sea info"></span><strong id="Sea info">Sea info</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Radiation of microscopic marine life in cretaceous:

<ul>
<li>
Diatoms

<li>
Plankton

</ul>
<li>
Reef building bivalves (Rudists) appear and become dominant reef builders

<li>
Ichthyosaurs become rare, die out before end of Cret.

<li>
Plesiosaurs arise (both long and short-necked forms

<li>
Sea turtles and Mosasuars appear

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Although many untestable hypothesis have been suggested, these contributing factors strong evidence

<li>
End Cretaceous Regression:

<ul>
<li>
Draining of epeiric seas altered terrestrial climates

<li>
Changed Earths albedo, thus its weather patterns

<li>
Produced more continental climates in interiors:

<ul>
<li>
deserts

<li>
Regional ecosystems and climates

</ul>
<li>
Occured over 4Ma

</ul>
<li>
Many untestable hypothesis suggested.

<li>
Chicxulub impact:

<ul>
<li>
In 1980 Walter Alvarez was investigating a clay layer in Italy at the K/Pg boundary

<li>
determine length of time rep'd by layer and possible cause

<li>
Lyaer globally high in iridium and shocked quartz, which is common in metallic asteroids, rare on earth

<li>
Proposed an asteroid impacted earth at K/Pg boundary

</ul>
</ul>

</p>
<ul>
<li>
Caculated probable size:

<ul>
<li>
10-15Km in diameter

<li>
Short term impact:

<ul>
<li>
1.8e8 megatons of energy released

<li>
vaporized anything within many km around

<li>
Shock wave generated huge tsunamis

</ul>
<li>
Long term effect:

<ul>
<li>
material vaporized by impact is kicked up into the atmosphere reducing sunlight

<li>
Dust and ash would block out the sun, killing off photosynthesizing organisms

<li>
This would have then killed off herbivores and finally carnivores

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>
Victims of K/Pg extinction:
	Ammonites
	Rudists
	Mosasaurs
	Pterosaurs
	All non-flying dinos and several groups of birds
	many mammal groups
	many others
