<ol>
<li>
Original horizontality - sediments were deposited originally as horizontal beds.

<li>
Lateral continuity - beds thin and pinch out laterally.

<li>
Superposition - overlying beds are younger than underlying beds in a succession of sedimentary strata that are undisturbed by tectonic forces.

<li>
Cross cutting relationships - a feature that disrupts a previously formed feature is younger than the one that disrupted.

</ol>
<div id="The Stratigraphic Record-Geologic time"><h5 id="Geologic time">Geologic time</h5></div>
<ul>
<li>
geology's greatest contribution to science (deep time).

<li>
emphasizes that geology  is a historical science. Rocks record evolution of the earth system and its biotic inhabitants.

<li>
earth scientists use observation, and the principles and tools of physics, chemistry , mathematics and biology to piece together the story from the clues left behind in rocks.

</ul>

<div id="The Stratigraphic Record-Relative Dating"><h5 id="Relative Dating">Relative Dating</h5></div>
<ul>
<li>
relies on principles of original horizontality, superposition and cross cutting relationships

<li>
can only determine that some event is older or younger than another

<li>
cannot determine the duration of an event

</ul>
