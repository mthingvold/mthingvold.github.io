<p>
Eight large plates
	several small plates
	not all plates move at the same rate or in the same way
</p>
	
<p>
	normal faults, reverse faults and slip faults
	reverse faults are compressional
	strike-slip faults are shearing (sliding past)
</p>
	
<p>
	Divergent boundary - two plates move apart, resulting in upwelling of material from the mantle to create new seafloor
		occurs at mid-ocean ridges can occur under continents t rift valleys
</p>
		
<p>
	Mid Ocean ridges
</p>
<ul>
<li>
site of crustal formation
	Convergent boundaries

<li>
two plates move together

<li>
process results in subduction

<li>
process takes place at conv. boundaries where one plate moves under another and sinks into the mantle due to gravity
	Oceanic ridges

<li>
spreading occurs along the oceanic ridge system

<li>
rates can account for all of earth's ocean basins within last 200 my

</ul>
	 
<p>
	 Orogeny - a process in which a section of the earth's crust is folded and deformed by lat compression
</p>
	 
<ul>
<li>
an orogenic belt develops when a continental plate is formed.

</ul>
<li>
beneath the lithosphere a mantle plume heats up the material above it

<li>
	this forms a divergent boundary

<li>
if this occurs benaeath an ocean basin,, a new mid-ocean ridge is formed

<li>
if below a continent, it forms a rift valley (East african rift valley)

<li>
Continental material begins to split apart forming a rift valley with volcanic activity
				The red sea exists because it's a rift valley filled with ocean water

<li>
As a rift widens, will eventually form an ocean basin

<li>
	this results in stable margin deposition

<li>
Along the active mid-ocean ridge, new <span id="-volcanic islands"></span><strong id="volcanic islands">volcanic islands</strong> form and move away from the ridge

<li>
if this is associated with a hot spot, this may develop a volcanic island chain

<li>
a hot spot is a point where there is always volcanic eruption

<li>
Hawaii is a subduction zone and a hotspot the islands slowly sink and become mountains



<ul>
<li>
at ocean-ocean subduction zones, this process generates volcanic island arcs with a deep-sea trench towards the subducted plate

<li>
At ocean-contineent subduction zones, this generates a volcanic arc with a deep sea trench towards the subducted plate.

<li>
In both cases, an accretionary wedge is formed

<ul>
<li>
A fold and thrust belt, where sediments and oceanic rocks are folded, faulted, and squished.	

<li>
Where is it happening today? Vancouver Island. There is marine and igneous sediment pileup forming a future mountain chain
		the rocky mountains can be sedimentary igneous or metamorphic

</ul>
</ul>
		
<ul>
<li>
Syncline

<ul>
<li>
Rocks folded (concave up)

<li>
Vertices at bottom

</ul>
<li>
Anticline

<ul>
<li>
Rocks folded (concave down)

<li>
Vertices at top

</ul>
</ul>
		
<ul>
<li>
Down the core of a volcanic arc is an igneous arc of plutons and on either side of this is a metamorphic belt

<li>
A backarc basin ( in the ocean) or foreland basin (continental) forms behind the region of uplift/volcanics due to downwarping of the crust

<li>
basins are typically flooded by ocean water it sinks

<li>
japan is an example of a back-arc basin

<li>
volcanoes form due to subducting oceanic crust

<li>
there is mantle upwelling due to the subduction

<li>


<li>
The backarc/forelande basin is typically fllooded by ocean water

<li>
drops relatively deep in short periods of geologic time

<ul>
<li>
deepwater shales and muds with coarser sediments and volcanic ash form layer called flysh.

<li>
coarser sediments flushed in due to earthquakes

</ul>
<li>
In continental system, foreland basin fills geologically quickly with flysch replaced by coastal sediments

<li>
form deltas, beaches and is a <span id="-clastic wedge"></span><strong id="clastic wedge">clastic wedge</strong>

<li>
As long as subduction continues, arc remains active

<ul>
<li>
 Island arcs can be pushed up onto the continent

<li>
Continents can become sutured together after colliding

<li>
This collison causes intense heat and pressure, resulting in metamorphosis of the rocks that are colliding together

<li>
Erosion begins to wear down the mountain range

</ul>
<li>
this causes deeper and deeper igneous and metamorphic belt rocks to be exposed

</ul>


<p>
The canadian shield is the root of a canadian mountain chain that existed billions of years ago -- made out of igneous/metamorphic rocsk
