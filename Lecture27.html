<p>
eg at noon two cars leave from the same intersection. One heads due north at 60 kmh the other due east at 80km/h How fast is the distance between them changing 2 hours later?
</p>

<p>
need an equation relating x,y,z.
x<sup><small>2+y</small></sup>2=z^2
diff implicitly: 2x*dx/dt +2y*dy/dt =2z*dz/dt
2(160)*80 +2(120)(60)=2(200)*dz/dt
dz/dt=100
at t=2 hours, the distance between the cars is increasing at 100km/h
</p>


<p>
P(x)=-x^2+500x-1500
How fast is the profit changing when 50 computers have been sold?
When 300 computers have been sold?
dx/dt=10 fin dp/dt
1*dp/dt =-2x*dx/dt + 500*dx/dt
1*dp/dt =-2(50)*10 + 500*10
dp/dt=4000
profit increasing by 4000$ a week when 50 computers have been sold.
</p>

<p>
dp/dt=-2(300)*10+500(10)
</p>
<blockquote>
=-1000
the profit is decreasing by 1000$/week when 300 computers are sold
</blockquote>

CHAPTER 4 - Exponential and log functions
Def: an exponential function is a function of the form y=a^x
with a&gt;0 and a!=1
a is called the base,x the exponent or power
eponentials and polynomials resemble each other but are different
</p>

<p>
What does an exponential function look like?
We can make a table of values and connect the dots to make a graph.
x	y=2^x
-3	2<sup><small>-3 = 1/2</small></sup>3 = 1/8
-2	2<sup><small>-2 =1/2</small></sup>2=1/4
-1	2^-1=1/2
0	1
1	2
2	4
3	8
</p>

<p>
One use of exponential functions: Compound interest 
F(t)=P(1+r/m)^(mt)
P : the principal the initial amount invested/borrowed
r: the annual interest rate (as a proportion) 0&lt;=r&lt;=1
Note: deprecation has r&lt;0
m: the number of compunding periods per year
t: time in years (indie)
F: future values(dependent)
</p>

<p>
compund period guide
</p>

<p>
annually m=1
semi-annually m=2
quarterly m=4
monthly   m=12
weekly    m=52
daily     m=365
hourly    m=8760
minute-ly m=525,600
second-ly m=31,536,000
</p>

<p>
eg find the future value of 100$ invested at 12% compounded quarterly for 8 years.
F=P(1+r/m)^m*t
P=100$
r=0.12
m=4
t=8
F=?
