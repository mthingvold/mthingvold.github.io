	Atmosphere - gaseous envelope extending from Earth's surface to an altitute of 100km
	Hydrosphere - Surface waters comprising all oceans, lakes, rivers, and groundwaters
	Cryosphere - polar ice caps, glaciers, and other surface ice and snow
	Biosphere - all organic matter related to life near Earth's surface

	Lithosphere - Strong rocky shell that comprises crust and mantle to about 100km, forms tectonic plates
	Asthenosphere - weak, ductile layer of mantle beneath the lithosphere that deforms to acommodate the horizontal and vertical motions of plate tectonics
	Deep mantle - mantle beneath asthenosphere, 400km deep to core-mantle boundary
	Outer core - Liquid shell composed of molten iron 2900km to 5150km
	inner core - solid iron 5150 to center 6370km

A change in the state of the system, which is called a perturbation
bring the state of the system back into equilibrium.

less dense continental crust floats on denser mantle, continental crust is less dense than oceanic crust.
