<p>
Rlative time - order of deposition of a body of rock based on position
Absolute - number representing the time a body of rock was deposited
</p>


<p>
Stratigraphy - Study of stratified rocks, especially their geometric relations, compositions, origins, and age relations
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Because sedimentary rocks are depositied, naturally form horizontal layers(strata)

</ul>
	
<ul>
<li>
Strata: Units of rock with distinct upper,lower surface distinguished by phys,chem,paleontological property

<li>
Stratification allows geoscientists to determine relative ages of the these layers

<li>
natural sequence to depositiong, therefore fossils found in said layers are also of utility for determining relative age

<li>
These are the Principles of stratigraphy

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Principle of original horizontality:

<ul>
<li>
Because strata are deposited under the flow of gravity, they form horizontal layers

<li>
If strata are not horizontal something disturbed post deposit

</ul>
<li>
Principle of Superposition:

<ul>
<li>
Unless they have been disturbed, the strata at the bottom were deposited first, and the ones on top of that are the next oldest etc.

<li>
Youngest strata is the layer on top

</ul>
<li>
Principla of lateral continuity:

<ul>
<li>
Sediments extend laterally in all directions until it thins and pinches out or terminates against the edge of the depositional basin

</ul>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>
As steno and others mapped stratigraphic units, they found that there were gaps or breaks in the layers.

<ul>
<li>
These gaps are called unconformities, and represent periods of erosion or non deposition

<li>
Hutton, who termed Uniformitarianism, studied these gaps and recognized that they represent aspects of relative time

</ul>
<li>
three types of uncomformities:

<ul>
<li>
disconformity

<ul>
<li>
Surface erosion/non-depo. is parallel with bedding planes

<li>
Bedding planes - Surface that seperates stratum, layer/bed of stratified rock from another

</ul>
<li>
Angular uncomformity

<ul>
<li>
Surface erosion which cuts across the bedding plane of lower strata

<li>
indicates that the rocks beneath were tilted or uplifted prior to erosion

</ul>
<li>
Nonconformity

<ul>
<li>
Erosional surface that downcuts into a crystalline rock

<li>
This is non-sedimentary, such as metamorphic or ingeous rocks.

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

	
<ul>
<li>
Principle of cross-cutting relationships

<ul>
<li>
Any Structure (fold, fault, weathering surface, igneous, intrusion, etc.) that cuts across another otherwise deformed strata is necessarily younger than the rocks and structures it cuts across or deforms

</ul>
<li>
Principle of Inclusions

<ul>
<li>
Any rock fragments involved as sediment or xenoliths in a unit are from an older rock unit than the one in which it was included

</ul>
</ul>



<p>
It was using these principles that early geologists were able to figure out the sequence in which sediments and the enviro they were deoposited changed over time.
</p>

<p>
It became important to modularly divide up the geologic record, Relative forms:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Lithostratigraphy - Physical attributes of the rock

<li>
Biostratigraphy - Using fossils

<li>
Chronostratigraphy - Time of deposition

</ul>


<p>
<span id="-Lithostratigraphy"></span><strong id="Lithostratigraphy">Lithostratigraphy</strong>
Basic unit of lithostratigraphy is a formation.
	A mappable unit with distinct upper/lower boundaries
	Will often represent a single depositional setting, and therefore a single rock type or set of related facies
</p>
	
<p>
Formations are definable by:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
have distinct upper and lower boundary

<li>
have type section: spot where formation exposed

<li>
Laterally continous

<li>
Stratigraphically contiou

<li>
mappable

</ul>

<p>
Each formation is given a name
Laterally continuous strata whithing formation called members
Several distinct, continuous but related formations may be combined into formal group.
Originally thought that boundaries between formations point in time, no matter where in space you were
</p>

<p>
Boundaries mean many times to many formations
</p>

<p>
<span id="-Biostratigraphy"></span><strong id="Biostratigraphy">Biostratigraphy</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Principle of fossil succession - there is a unique, non-repeating pattern of fossils through stratigraphic time:

<ul>
<li>
All rocks containing fossils of the same species were deposited during the duration of that species on earth

<li>
Fossils that are used for correlating strata are ferred to as index fossils

</ul>
<li>
In order to be an index fossils, these criteria must be met:

<ul>
<li>
Have been very common

<li>
Have hard parts

<li>
Have wide geographic range

<li>
Lived in many different environments

<li>
Have distinctive features

<li>
Have shortt geological duration

</ul>
<li>
Biostratigraphy allowed strata around the world to be correlated as knowledge of index fossils increased.

<ul>
<li>
Eventually, geologists were able to establish a global set of sequences of appearances and disappearances of fossils

<li>
fundamental unit of biostrat is the <span id="-biozone"></span><strong id="biozone">biozone</strong>, which is defnied as the body of rock between the first appearance of an organism and last appearance of an index fossil species

<p>
Geologic Timescale relies heavily on Chronostratigraphy:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Branch of stratigraphy that studies age of rock strata in relation to time

<li>
Relies heavily on isotope geology to derive absolute ages of stratgraph units

</ul>
<p>
Combining lithostratigraphy &amp; biostrat allowed relative correlation throughout Europe and the world
Discovery of radioactive decay made it possible to determine the age of rocks
</p>

<p>
Radiometric dating is important for establishing a numerical age of rocks
Radioactive materials decay predictably (half-life)
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Atoms decay from parent to daughter product

<li>
By comparing the ratio of parent material to daughter material you can date the rock

</ul>

<p>
Useful isotopes
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Uranium 238 and thorium 232

<li>
Uranium 238 and lead 206

<li>
Rubidium-Strontium

<li>
Potassium-Argon

</ul>

<p>
It's only possible to radiometrically date igneous rock types
</p>

<p>
The boundaries between chronostratigraphic units must be instant (zero geo time) and isochronous(same everywhere)
</p>
<ul>
<li>
This forms the basis of geochronologic units

</ul>
<p>
Geochronologic unit
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Interval during which each chronostrat unit was formed * Eras, period, stage

</ul>

<div id="Units of Time-Geochronology"><h3 id="Geochronology">Geochronology</h3></div>
<p>
Each period has a formal name(eg cretaceous) as does each stage(campanian, maastrichtian)
In the mid 1800s, john phillips grouped different periods based on characteristic fossils:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Paleozoic (ancient animal life)

<li>
Mesozoic (middle animal life)

<li>
Cenozoic (recent animal life)

<li>
These were based on overall paterns in changing abundance of different invertebrate groups:

<ul>
<li>
(major mass extinctions)

</ul>
</ul>
