<div id="Formation of the Universe-Origin of planet Earth"><h3 id="Origin of planet Earth">Origin of planet Earth</h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
Big Bang Theory - model that explains the development of the universe

<li>
Occured about 14 billion years ago

<li>
notion that universe started from one point

<li>
ALl componenets of atom come from

<ul>
<li>
universe is 75% hydrogen

<li>
25% is helium with the rest being trace amounts

<li>
all elements formed in stars

</ul>
</ul>



<p>
	evidence?
	universe has beginning
	galaxies moving away
	abundance of helium/hydrogen
</p>
		
	
<p>
	Nebular hypothesis -- bodies in solar system evolved from solar nebula
</p>
	
<p>
	Rocky planets
</p>
<ul>
<li>
form in the inner part of the protoplanetary disk.

<li>
Results from coagulation of rock grains

<li>
Asteroid belt (mars/jupiter)

</ul>
	
<div id="Formation of the Universe-Origin of planet Earth-The Sun"><h4 id="The Sun">The Sun</h4></div>
	
<p>
	Star is the centre of the solar system
	Mostly hydrogen - rest helium
</p>
<ul>
<li>
generates heat by fusing hydrogen into helium

</ul>
	
<ul>
<li>
When out of hydrogen fuses helium into carbon

<ul>
<li>
becomes red giant

</ul>
<li>
once helium is used will begin to fuse carbon into iron, shrinks to become a white dwarf

</ul>
	
<ul>
<li>
Once all carbon has fused into iron, a large star will become a supernova

<ul>
<li>
the core of the sun would be crushed into a neutron star.

<li>
For very large stars ( much larger than our sun) this would create a black hole.

</ul>
</ul>


<div id="Formation of the Universe-Origin of planet Earth-Formation of Earths Layers"><h4 id="Formation of Earths Layers">Formation of Earths Layers</h4></div>
<ul>
<li>
Chemical segregation early in the formation of earth by gravity

<li>
Earth's Layers can be defined by:

<ul>
<li>
Chemical composition

<li>
physical properties

</ul>
<li>
Core - inner layer: iron rich, dense

<li>
Mantle - largest layer between core and crust composed of iron, magnesium and oxygen-seeking elements

<li>
Crust - solid thin outer layer

</ul>
