EG find relative rate of change of f(x)e^xlnx
f^<sup><small>x=(e</small></sup>x)^<sup><small>*lnx+e</small></sup>x*ln(x)^^
e<sup><small>x*ln(x)+e</small></sup>x*1/x
=e<sup><small>x*lnx+e</small></sup>x*1/x  /  e^xlnx
</p>

<p>
lnx+1/x / lnx
xlnx+1x/ xlnx
</p>

Elasticity of demand
Elasticity is an eco concept that tracks the responsiveness of the quantity of a good or service demanded by consumers to a change in price
Elasticity is the percent change in demand divided by percent change in price: eg
if you change the price of your lemonade by 3% and sales go up 15% elasticity is 15%/3%=5 demand is elastic if elasticity &gt;1 inelastic if &lt;1 unit-elastic if =1
</p>

<p>
a demand is responsive to changes in price an inelastic demand is not.
</p>

<p>
To increase revenue: 
If demand is elastic, lower price
if inelastic raise price
if unit-elastic maintain
</p>

<p>
DEF: con demand = d(P
Elasticity = (-pD^^(p))/(D(p))
</p>

<p>
ifD(p) =-2(15 - 0.001p)^2
-p(-.004(15-0.001p))/2(15-0.001p)^2
= 8 p=12000
elasticity &gt;1 demand is elastic

5.1 antiderivatives
A major theme is math operations have opposits add/sub mult/div powers/roots
distribute/factor exponentials/logsA
</p>

<p>
we have spent most of the course learning diff
what is the opposite of a derivative 
answer: an antiderivative/integral
</p>

<p>
def: the indefinite integral or antideriv of f(x) is denoted 
f(x)dx
</p>

<p>
and is defined as follows
AD  f(x)dx = gx +c 
if and only if g^^x = fx
notes: 
</p>
<ol>
<li>
The dx can be considered as part of the integral sign. it tells you what variable you are integrating with respect to, and also denotes where the integral ends. Once you compute the integral the dx goes away

</ol>
<p>
AD x^2+x+3 dx
</p>
<ol>
<li>
every indefinite integ includes a +c because the derivative of a constant is zero. we would need more info to figure out C.

</ol>

<p>
EG find AD 2x dx
AD 2x dx(f(x) =g(x)+C
iff g^^(x) =2xf(x)
AD2xdx =x^2+C
check: (x<sup><small>2+C)</small></sup>^=2x+0 =2x YEE BBOIIIIIIIIIIIIII
</p>

<p>
One of the few nice things about integrals is that you can always check your answer by taking the derivative and seeing if you get back to where you started.
</p>

<p>
Basic integral rules
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Integral Power Rule
 AD x<sup><small>n dx = 1/n+1 *x</small></sup>(n+1)+C(for n != -1)
 integral constant multiple rule
 AD kf(x)dx=kADf(x)dx
 for k constant

<li>
Integ of a constant
   AD k dx =kx +C for k constant

<li>
Sume rule for integrals
   AD f(x) + g(x)dx= AD f(x)dx + AD g(x)dx
   note we hanve no integ product quotient or chain rule thank the lord
   Anything that looks like a comp mult or div will have to be simplified somehow

</ol>
   
<p>
   Find ADx^5dx
   AD x<sup><small>5 dx=1/5+1 x</small></sup>6 +C
   check 1/6x<sup><small>6 +C</small></sup><sup><small> = x</small></sup>5
   Find AD -4x dx
   =-4 ADxdx
   =-4(1/2x^2)+C
   =-2x^2+C
</p>
   
<p>
   find AD sqrt7 dx
   =sqrt7x x+C
</p>
   
<p>
   find AD 0dx
   0x+Cj
   C
