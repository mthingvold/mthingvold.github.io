<ol>
<li>
The proof from the idea of go- proof by effect

<li>
The proof from self-preservation- proof by effect

<li>
The ontological proof

</ol>

<p>
The setting of proofs is <span id="-key"></span><strong id="key">key</strong>:
Introduces two ideas:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Objective/formal reality of ideas

<li>
The principle of causality 

</ol>

<p>
Formal/objective reality of ideas
formal reality:
pertians to the form of ideas:  as ideas all ideas are the same
</p>

<p>
objective:
pertains to the content of ideas:  objective reality of an ideas depends on the reality of the object it represents.
</p>

<p>
Three kinds of object: Accident, Substance, Infinite Substance
</p>

<p>
The principle of causality:
	a cause has at least as much reality as its effect.
as applied to the obj reality of ideas:
	the objective reality of an idea is caused by the reality it represents
	the degree of reality of the rep object is at least as great as the degree of reality of its idea.
</p>
	
<p>
Argumentative strategy: could i be the cause of this idea?
</p>

<p>
Proof by elimination
</p>

<p>
Could i be the cause of the following ideas?
1-thinking thing
2- living beings
3-corporeal inanimate things
4- god
i have the idea of god, only god could cause this idea therefore god exists
</p>

<p>
i have the idea of god, only god could cause this idea therefore god exists
</p>

<p>
OBJECTION
our mind could be the source of this idea.
this implies we have a degree of reality that corresponds to the degree this idea possesses.
</p>

<p>
Two premises:
1/By comparison to god's perfection, i seem quite imperfect.
2/ from whom in that case would i derive my existence.
</p>

<p>
proof by elimination
</p>

<p>
From whom could 'I' derive my existence?
	self
	parents
	some other material cause
</p>
	
<p>
two intermediary premises to eliminate(1):
1/Only an almighty being cna bring the I into existence
2/ Present existence can't be inferred from past existence.
