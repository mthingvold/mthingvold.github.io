	There are two kinds of infinity, big deal but it doesn't matter if the universe is counatbly infinite

</ol>
	
	
<p>
	Godel's incompleteness theorem states all languages rich enough to reason mathematics contain true statements that are unprovable
	Everything that is true (in the sense of a truth table) can be proven (in the sense of a proof) and vice versa.
	same is true of predicate calculus with quantifiers, but add arithmetic to the mix.
	It becomes possible to use the arithmetic to imitate what a proof looks like.
	The proofs we ahve so far are finite
	The set of proofs is countable.

	Can you name "the smallest positive integer not definable in under eleven words". the problem is self-referentiality

Computing
	Building an infinite loop detector
	Let P be the set of all programs, and D be the set of all inputs. Note that P is a subset of D.
	It is easy to write a C program that goes into an infinite loop all by itself:
	void main()
	{
		while(true);
	}

</ol>
	
<p>
	useful programs read data. So we might have the following (this is not actual C anymore)
	void main()
	{
		char *data = readFile("file.txt");
		if (data == "loop")
			while (true);
	}
</p>
	
<p>
	This is an ornery program
</p>
	
<p>
	The infinite loop detector has to read two pieces of input - a program, and its data. write a function
		bool halts (char* program, char *data);
	then we can write this program and store it in infiniteloopdetector.c
</p>
	
<p>
		void main()
		{
			if (!halts("ild.c","ild.c"))
</p>
<blockquote>
exit(0);
</blockquote>
<p>
			else
</p>
<blockquote>
while(true);
</blockquote>
<p>
		}
</p>
		
<p>
		halts when it goes into an infi loop and goes into an infi loop when it halts
</p>

Philosophy, Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive Science
	Interesting that we humans can find infinite loops, but the process provably cannot be automated.
