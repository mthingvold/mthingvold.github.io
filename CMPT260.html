computer has no concept of a continous number

<p>
Logic implemented as a bit (on, off)
</p>

<p>
Aristotles' syllogism
</p>

<p>
Suppose A-&gt;B and you know A
Then B
</p>

<p>
A V ~A to be or not be -- a or not a
b /\ ~b -- b and not b -- always false -- or is vsauce?
</p>

<p>
if 0 was = to 1 therefore 1=2 -- with one false statement you can "prove" anything in the world
</p>


<p>
if there is a quantifier for a variable it is bound to the quantifier. A variable that is not bound to a quantifier is free.
A bound variable is actually the way that the quantifier works. It is not a variable in the usual sense.
The scope of a quantifier is the next predicate, or the next parenthesized expression. You can change the names of variables, but  be careful not to confuse different variables, and free and bound variables.

<p>
	GeneralProofs-- find one example to prove something exists without picking something specific.
	eg in a set of numbers at least one above average, x one is below
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Disprove all of xP(x) wtih 1 counter example

</ol>

<p>
	To show that all x P(x) let x be a particular but arbitrarily chosen element of the domain set, and show P(x) iis true.
	Show
	all x EZ such
