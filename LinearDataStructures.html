<p>
Lists are abstract data types that manage collecting data in a linear ordering.
The order may or may not matter. 
minimum features:
	create a new, empty list
	insert a new data item at the front
	insert a new data item at the end of the list
	delete the first item in the list
	delete the last item in the list
	obtain the i-th item in the list
</p>

<p>
In this course a list implemented by a node chain is called a linked list. 
A linked list is a series of nodes in a linear order
