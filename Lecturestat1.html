<p>
A parameter is a numerical quantity calculated from data in a population.
a statistic is a numerical quantity calculated from data in a sample.
</p>

<p>
A variable is an observable or measurable characteristi or property of indiv. objects

<li>
Let C be the colour of stat 245 students' eyes

<span id="-types of variables"></span><strong id="types of variables">types of variables</strong>
	Quantitative - numerical counts/measures
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Discrete - represents that can be counted

<li>
Continuous - represents that which is measured
	Qualitative - classification based on attributes or characteristics or properties

<li>
Nominal - no ranked nor ordered distinctions are possible

<li>
Ordinal - Observations can be ranked/ordered

<li>
Interval - Observations that are also ranked or ordered. Here an equal difference in magnitude. However, a zero value does not mean nothing.

<li>
Ratio - Observations are ranked or ordered, an equal difference means an equal difference in magnitude and here, a zer value means nothing.

<li>
Observational study - Data is collected straight off from a random sample. We do not influence the values of the variables in the study. Variables not controlled.

<li>
Designed experiment - experiment compares treated group to a control group.

<span id="-Random Sampling"></span><strong id="Random Sampling">Random Sampling</strong>
A simple random sample(SRS) of sizen n from population size N is such that every element in pop is equally likely of being selected to be in the sample.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Each element has the probability n/N of being selected

<li>
order of selection doesn't matter

</ul>
<p>
Definition: <span id="-Sampling without replacement"></span><strong id="Sampling without replacement">Sampling without replacement</strong> - no element if selected may be selected more than once.
w/o replacement the total number of different possible samples is

SRS of 5 cards is to be selected from 52 playing cards, how many 5-card hands are there
	(52!)/(5!(52-5)!) = 52!/(5!*47!)
