<p>
Archosaurs emerge, two distinct groups dominating
Due to climate conditions able to outcompete therapsids
</p>

<p>
End Triassic extinction solidifies dinosaurs as the dominant terrestrial group
</p>

</p>

<p>
Turtles - Reptiles characterized by special bony or cartilaginous shell developed from their ribs
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Divided into two main groups:

<ul>
<li>
Cryptodira - lower their necks and pull their heads straight back into their shells:

<ul>
<li>
evolved in jurassic

</ul>
<li>
Pleurodira - fold necks along body under shell margin late triassic

</ul>
<li>
Originally were thought to have evolved from a group called anapsids, characterized by having no openings in skulls

</ul>
<li>
now know turtles first evolved a plastron (belly pan) and later evolved complete shell.


<ul>
<li>
Dinosaur - defined as being a group that consists of Triceratops, Neornithes, and their most recent common ancestors and descendants:

<ul>
<li>
More broadly defined as archosaurs with hind limbs held erect beneath their body, as well as several anatomical features defined by their bones

</ul>
<li>
Dinosaurs are further divided into two broad groups on the basis of their pelvis structure:

<ul>
<li>
Saurischians - defined by a 'lizard-like' pelvis, where they have retained the three-pronged pelvis of lizards

<ul>
<li>
Includes all sauropods and theropods

</ul>
<li>
Ornithischians - defined by bird-like pelvis, where the pubis is rotated backwards, like birds:

<ul>
<li>
Includes hadrosaurs, ceratopsians, ankylosaurs

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<div id="tri recap-Tri-Jur Extinction"><h3 id="Tri-Jur Extinction">Tri-Jur Extinction</h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
Boundary between triassic and jurassic periods 201Ma

<ul>
<li>
one of major extinctions since permian profound affect

</ul>
<li>
34% marine genera go extinct

<li>
all archosaurs other than crocodilians and ornithodira go extinct

<li>
All therapsids go extinct &amp; many large amphibians

</ul>

<p>
<span id="tri recap-Tri-Jur Extinction-Causes"></span><strong id="Causes">Causes</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
several explanations:

<ul>
<li>
gradual climate change, sea-level fluctuations and pulse of ocean acidification known to have occurred

<li>
asteroid impact suggested, no crater know big enough to have caused an extinction

<li>
massive volcanic eruptions are known to have occurred in the atlantic, releases carbon dioxide &amp; sulfur dioxide and other toxic aerosols(dramatic effect climate)

</ul>
<li>
We don't know

</ul>

<div id="tri recap-Jurassic and Cretaceous"><h3 id="Jurassic and Cretaceous">Jurassic and Cretaceous</h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
Time period marked by Jurassic - Triassic mass extinction

<li>
56 Ma from 201Ma to 145Ma

<li>
Cretaceous spans 79 Ma from end jurassic 145 Ma until paleogene:

<ul>
<li>
ushers in Cenozoic

<li>
End of cretaceous marked by mass extinction

</ul>
<li>
time of dinos

</ul>
<p>
<a href="Ornithischia.html">Ornithischia</a>
</p>

<ul>
<li>
In cretaceous increased rates of seafloor spreading, causing the continents to move further apart at faster rate

<li>
Worldwide transgression, possibly largest since cambrian time:

<ul>
<li>
resulted in much of the world at the time being inundated by continental seaways

<li>
NA split in two, having profound effects on biodiversity at the time

</ul>
<li>
Climate was globally warm and mild:

<ul>
<li>
SK AB subtropical

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Saurischians"><h2 id="Saurischians">Saurischians</h2></div>
<ul>
<li>
Name means 'reptile hipped' and is the other branch of the two basic divisions of dinosaurs:

<ul>
<li>
the other being ornithischia

</ul>
<li>
This group includes all theropods and the sauropods:

<ul>
<li>
Theropods are almost entirely carnivorous dinos, few weirdd omnivores and herbivores evolving in the Cretaceous

<li>
Sauropods are the long-necked dinosaurs, and are the largest known land animals to have ever been known to exist

<ul>
<li>
All are herbivorous

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Saurischians-Sauropods"><h3 id="Sauropods">Sauropods</h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
Name means 'lizard-footed' and are characterized by long necks and tails, large sizze, and were quadrupedal:

<ul>
<li>
Were the largest land animals to have ever existed

</ul>
<li>
Were able to grow to such large sizes in part due to the structure of their bones:

<ul>
<li>
Theropod counterparts, had hollow bones

<li>
Had pneumatics sacs which surrounded their bones, making them lighter for their size

</ul>
<li>
Were common in the Jurassic, but decline dramatically in the cretaceous

</ul>
<div id="Saurischians-Theropoda"><h3 id="Theropoda">Theropoda</h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
Name means wild footed beasts and are characterized by hollow bones and three toes:

<ul>
<li>
Generally were carnivorous, but a few evolved to be herbivorous/omnivorous

</ul>
<li>
Extremely diverse group:

<ul>
<li>
Coelurosaurs - large carnivores that include that include Tyrannosaurs and Archaeopteryx

<li>
 Maniraptora - group within the Coelurosaurs that include raptors and Therizinosaurs

</ul>
<li>
Posses several interesting characters, some of which are now know to be shared with other animals...

</ul>
