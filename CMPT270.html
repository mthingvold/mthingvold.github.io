</p>
<ul>
<li>
Eliminate irrelevant details

<li>
ignore relevant details that aren't needed for the current task

<li>
generalize the  problem to handle more situations and allow its reuse

</ul>

</p>
<ul>
<li>
Most software systems are very complex

<li>
Often the key to solving a complex problem is decomposition

<ul>
<li>
Divid complex problems into smaller problems

<li>
solve small problems

<li>
Combine the results of sub to solve orginal

</ul>
<li>
Subproblems are solved by recursively applying the approach, until problems are obtained that are simle enough to directly solve.

</ul>
		
<ul>
<li>
Use abstraction to ignore details of how subproblem is solved

<li>
Need spec of what the subproblem does

<li>
For a method, the spec consists of 

<ul>
<li>
signature

</ul>
<li>
precondition

<li>
postcondition (including return value)

</ul>
		
<p>
		Guidelines:
			Locality
			Strong Cohesion
			Weak coupling
</p>

	<span id="3layerarchitecture-Locality"></span><strong id="Locality">Locality</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Keep related things as close together as poosible

<li>
related things should be local

</ul>
