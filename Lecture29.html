eg simplify inn 25 - ln 5 eg simpliify ln(x/e)+1 
law2 ln(x)-ln(e)+1
	ln(x)-1+1
	= ln(x)
</p>
	
<p>
eg break up into four log terms
ln((x<sup><small>3-x</small></sup>2)/((x+1)(x-3)))
ln(x<sup><small>3-x</small></sup>2)-ln[(x+1)(x-3)]
ln[x^2(x-1)]-ln[(x+1)(x-3)]
law1 ln(x^2)+ ln(x-1) -[ln(x+1)+ln(x-3)]
</p>

<p>
eg write as a single log and simplify 
ln(x-2)+2ln(x^3+2) - 3ln(2-x)
law = ln(x-2)+ln(x<sup><small>3+2)</small></sup>2 -ln(2-x)^3
law1 ln[(x-2)(x<sup><small>3+2)</small></sup>2] - ln(2x)^3
law2 = ln[((x-2)(x<sup><small>3+2)</small></sup>2)/(2-x)^3]
=ln[-1((-x+2)(x<sup><small>3+2)</small></sup>2)/(2-x)^2]
=ln[-1(x<sup><small>3+2)</small></sup>2 / (2-x)^2
</p>

<p>
two new operations we can use when solving equations:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
we can take the nat log of both sides of an equation 
   eg x=3
   ln(x) = ln(3)
   x+y=5
   ln(x+y)=ln(5)

</ol>
   
<ol>
<li>
We can exponentiate both sides of an equation with base e 
   e.g. x=3
   e<sup><small>x=e</small></sup>3

</ol>
   
<p>
eg solve 2^x=7
Take ln of both sides
ln(2^x)=ln(7)
law 3 xln(2)=ln(7)
x=ln7/ln2
</p>

<p>
eg solve 3^(x-1) =2
ln(3^(x-1) =ln(2)
(x-1)ln(3)=ln(2)
x-1=ln2/ln3
x=ln2/ln3+1
</p>

<p>
solve 2e<sup><small>x</small></sup>2 -7=0
e<sup><small>x</small></sup>2=7/2
x^2*ln(e)=ln(7/2)
x^2=ln(7/2)
x=+-sqrt(ln(7/2))
</p>

<p>
e.g. Solve ln(x)=4
x=e^4
</p>

<p>
Compund interest again
Logarithms provide the tool we need to solve for t in a compound interest question where F,P,r and m are given.
</p>

<p>
The most usual type of problem here asks for the doubling time( or tripling time or quad time, etc.) of an investment. 
</p>

<p>
Fact: Given the same rate and compounding, it takes the same amount of time for any principal to double in size.
</p>

<p>
eg what is the doubling time of an investment at 7% interest compounded monthly
</p>

<p>
r=0.07
m=12
P=P
F=2P or let p=1
t=?
</p>

<p>
2P=P(1+0.07/12)<sup><small>12t 2= (1+0.07/12)</small></sup>12t
ln2=12t*(1+0.07/12)
ln2/12ln(1+0.07/12)t=9.93 years
</p>

<p>
e.g How long will it take an investment at 5% compounded continuously to increase in value by 30%?
</p>

<p>
1.3=1*e^0.05t 
ln(1.3)=0.05tlne
ln(1.3) 0.05te
t=ln(1.3/0.05
t=5.247 years
</p>

<p>
EG the value of a snowmobiel depreeciates at a rate of 12% per year when will it be worth one third of it's original price?
</p>

<p>
1/3=1*e^-0.12t
ln(1/3)=ln(e^0.12t)
ln1/3/-0.12=t
t=8.594 yeares
</p>

Carbon-14 dating
All organisms contain trace amounts of radioactive carbon.
This amount stays relatively constant while the org is alive, but diminishes slowly after the org demise through rad decay.
</p>

<p>
Because scientists know the rate c-14 decayds and the levels present in living organisms.. They can measure the amount of rad carbon and calc how old it is.
</p>

<p>
Formula: Let P(t) after the prop of C-14 remaining after t years
Then P(t)=e^(-0.00012t)
rad decay works the same as dep of value.
</p>

<p>
e.g. you find a battle axe with a wooden handle that contains 90% of its original c-14 how old is it?
P=0/9
0.9=e^-0.00012t
ln(0.9)=-0.00012t
t=ln(0.9)/-0.00012

<p>
read over real world exp probs found at end of section 4.2 HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAH he actually expects us to reead the textbook the absolute madman lmao
</p>

<p>
4.3 deriv of exponential and log functions
two new derivative rules to add to your list
Exponential Rule:
(e<sup><small>x)</small></sup><sup><small>=e</small></sup>x
</p>

<p>
note that you must NOT use the power rule to take the derivative of the exp function y=e^x:
e<sup><small>x</small></sup><sup><small> != xe</small></sup>(x-1)
</p>

<p>
Log rule:
ln(x)^^=1/x
</p>

<p>
These two new rules work in combo with all othere rules product rule etc
</p>
