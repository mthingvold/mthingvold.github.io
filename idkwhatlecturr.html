socrates on elements:
Elements:
1)have no account
</p>
<ol>
<li>
can only be name

<li>
unkowable

<li>
only perceptible

<li>


</ol>
<p>
complexes
</p>
<ol>
<li>
have an account formed bey weaving elements together

<li>
expressible in an account

<li>
knowable

<li>
can be fu

</ol>

<p>
the paradox:
on this view knowledge relies on what is unknowable
knowledge is defined as true judgement with an account
an account is formed by weaving elements together
elements are unknowable
hence knowledge relies on what is knowable
</p>

syllables are complexes formed of letters
syllables are entities

is justified treu belief knowledge by edmund gettier
standard definition
S knows that P iff:
	P is true,
	S believes that P, and
	S is justified in believing that P
	ex. 'sky is blue'
	i know sky is blue iff:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
sky is blue == true

<li>
i believe sky is blue and

<li>
i am justified in believing that "the sky is blue"

</ol>
	
<p>
the point of gettiers arg:
the standardclaim:
these are necessary and sufficient cond for knowledge
getter's claim:
they are necessary conditions but not sufficient
</p>

<p>
Gettier's counter-example: jones and smith apply for the same job.
smith has strong reasons to believe:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
that jones will get the job;

<li>
that jones has ten coins in his pocket.

</ol>
<p>
then smith is justified in believing 1 and 2
then smith is also justified in believing that:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
the man who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket.

</ol>
<p>
smith gets the job and smith happens to have ten coins in his pockets
