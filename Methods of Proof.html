		prove a 4 digit number that adds up t 9 is div by 9
</p>
		
<p>
		proof:
			Let X be a 4 digit number, let A,B,C be its digits such that the digits add up to 9 [Direct Proof]
			Then we know a+b+c+d=9k, k is some arbitrary int
			x=a*1000+b*100+c*10+d
			=a(999+1)+b(99+1)+c(9+1)+d
			999a+99b+9c+a+b+c+d
			999a+99b+9c+9k
			9(111a+11b+c+k)
			therefore, x must be divisible by 9

		n^2+5 is not divisible by 4
		proof:
		2 cases
			case 1: N is even
</p>
<blockquote>
Then N = 2k where k is some int
so (n<sup><small>2)+5=((2k)</small></sup>2)+5
=4k^2+5
=4k^2+4+1
=4(k^2+1)+1
Thus if n is even n^2+5 is not div by 4
</blockquote>
<p>
			Case 2: n is odd
</p>
<blockquote>
Then N = 2k+1 where k is some int
n<sup><small>2+5=(2k+1)</small></sup>2+5
=4k^2+4k+1+5
=4k(k^2+k+1+2)
thus, for all odd integers n, n^2+5 is not divisible by 4.
Therefore for all integers n, n^2 + 5 is not divisible by 4; by proof by cases.

			proof:
</p>
<blockquote>
let m and n be 2 integers such that int m+n is even
assume that one of m and n is even
then m+n=(2j)+(2k+1) 
m+n=2(j+k)+1
thus m+n is odd if exactly one of m/n is even
thiscontradicts the statement that m+n is even,
therefore if m+n is even then either m or n must be even or neither must be

		we will show that if m and n are both odd, then m*n is odd.
		let m=2j+1, n=2k+1, wherej and k are arbitrary integers
		Then m*n=(2j+1)*(2k+1)
			=4jk+2j+2k+1
			=2(2jk+j+k)+1
</p>
			
<p>
		Thus, if m and n are both odd, m*n is odd.
		Therefore by proof by contraposition we know that if m * n is even
		then m is even or m is even
