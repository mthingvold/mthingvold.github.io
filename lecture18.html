<p>
eg where is y=^3sqrtx diff
note that domain is |R so fx is continuous at all points
y^<sup><small> = 1/3x</small></sup>(-2/3)
	= 1/(3x^(2/3)
y^^ will be undefined when the denominator is zero x=0
so y=^3sqrtx is differentiable on -inf,0 U 0, inf

Chapter 3: apps of derivatives
	3.1 Graph using first derivative
		Recall that the derivative f^^ of a function f gives us a way of calculating the slope of the tangent line at any point on f:
		also recall f^^(x)&gt;0 the f(x) incr
		f^^(x)&lt;0 fx dec
			=0 flat
		if f^^x is undefined the f(x) is nondifferentiable (has a verticall tangent or cusp, or is discontinuous)
		def: a crit number of f(x) is an x-value in the domain of f where either f^<sup><small>(x)=0 or f</small></sup>^(x) is undefined
</p>
		
<p>
		Functions often (not always) have relative/local max or min values at crit numbers
		informaslly a local max is the top of a hil a local min is the bottom of a valley
		These points are called relative / local extrema and are key points on the graph of any function a point has two coordinates!!!
</p>
		
<p>
		to figure out whether a critical number of f(x) is the location of m

<li>
find the domain of f(x)

<li>
find f^^x using derivative rules

<li>
find the critical numbers of f(x). This usually means setting the numerator and denominator of f^^(x) to zero and solving

<li>
draw a number line and plot the critical numbers and the location of any vertical asymptotes on it. Note where f is undefined using the domain

<li>
pick any one test value you like from each of the regions between the values plotted in step 4. Evaluate f^^(x) at each test value and record whether the result is bigger or less than zero (postive or negative) ( above num line)

<li>
Draw arrows underneath the number line indicating whether f(x) is increasing, decreasing, flat, or vertically asymptotic

<li>
Use this info to classify each critical numbers as being the location of a relative max, relative min, or neither.

</ol>
		
<p>
		Step 7 invokes the first derivative test:
		If f(x) has a critical number at x=c then if f is increasing before x=c and decreasing after x=c then f(x) has a relative/local max at x=c
		if f(x) has a crit number at x=c then if f is decreasing before x=c and incrasing after x=c then f(x) has a relative/local minimum at x=c
</p>
		
<p>
		e.g Find and classify the relative extrema of the given function by performing sign analysis. write the intervals of increase/decrease.
		f(x)=x<sup><small>3 +3x</small></sup>2+4
		1)Domain:|R
</p>
<ol>
<li>
f^<sup><small>(x)=3x</small></sup>2+6x

<li>
find crit numbers 3x^2+6x=0		3x(x+2)=0	3x=0	x+2=0 									x=0 x=-2

<li>
draw a number line :c --+(-3)+--x=-2--(-1)---x=0--+(1)+-----

<li>
evaluate f^^x at each test value (-3)&gt;0 (-1)&lt;0 (1)&gt;0

<li>
so x=-2 is the location of a lcoal maximu, x=0 is a minimum -2,8 is a local max
		x=0 is location of local minimu (0,4) local minimuum

</ol>
		
<p>
		f is increasing on (-infinity,-2)U(0,inf) F IS decreasoing on (-2,0)
		to sketch f(x)
</p>
		
<ol>
<li>
find the domain of f(x)

<li>
find the x and y intercepts of f(x) if not too difficult

<li>
find any vert/horizontal asymptotes of f(x) if any

<li>
find crit numbers of f(x) by diff, then perform sign analysis to classify theme FIND CRIT POINTS ?

<li>
plot key points and asymptotes and complete the sketch make a table of values if more points are needed
		sketch f(x) = x<sup><small>3 +3x</small></sup>2+4

<ol>
<li>
domain |R

<li>
intercepts y=4 , x: x<sup><small>3 +3x</small></sup>2+4 too hard to solve!

<li>
asymptotes: None polynomial have no asymptotes!

<li>
Done previously (-2,8) max, (0,4) min (-inf,-2)U(0,inf) incr, (-2,0) decreasing

<li>
put it all together ( just wolfram alpha this)
