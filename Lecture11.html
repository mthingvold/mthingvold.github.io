CONTINUITY
</p>

<p>
if you can draw graph without lifitng pencil
</p>

<p>
Def: a function f(x) is continuous at x=a if:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
f(a) is defined

<li>
lim x-&gt;a f(x) exists and

<li>
lim x-&gt;a f(x) =f(a)

</ol>

<p>
	eg is y=x^2 continouous at x=2?
		f(2)=2^2=4 defined
		lim x-&gt; 2 f(x) = lim x-&gt;2 x^2 = 4 limit exists
		4= f(2)=lim f(x) = 4 so y=x^2 is continuous at x=2
	eg is f(x)=sqrtx continuous at x=-3
		1 f(-3)=sqrt(-3) undefined so, fx is not continues(discontinuosu at x=-3)
	eg is f(x) = sqrt x continuous at x=0
		1 f(0)=sqrt0 =0
		lim x-&gt;0 sqrt x domain x&gt;= 0 [0,inf)
		lim x-&gt;- sqrt x does not exist
		but it is right continuous
</p>
		
<p>
		f(2)=2+2=4 limf(x) = lim x+2 = 2+2=4
</p>
		
<p>
	is f(x) = { x+2 if x&gt;=0 {-x if x&lt;0
	1 f(0)=2
	2 x=0 is a transition so do oneA sided limites
	lim x-&gt;0<sup><small>- = lim x-&gt;0</small></sup>- -x = 0
	lim x-&gt;0^+ =x+2 =2
	0!= 2 so lim fx x-&gt;0 Does not exist DISCONTINUOus
</p>
	
<p>
	eg is f(x)={x+2 if x!=3 {1 if x=3
		continuous at x=3
		1 f(3) = 1
		2 lim x-&gt; 3 f(x) = lim x+2=3+2=5
		3 1!=5 so the function is discontinuous
</p>
		
<p>
Rates of change, slopes, and derivatives
	eg suppose it takes you two hours to drive the 260 km from saskatoon to regina
</p>
<ol>
<li>
what was the avg speed 260/2 = 130km/h
			avg speed = delta d /delta t = dsub2-dsub1 / t2-t1

<li>
what was the instantaneous speed at some particular time during the trip
		 y=f(x) avg rate of change = delt y / delt x y2-y1 / x2-x1
		 = f(x2) - f(x1) / x2-1

</ol>
		 
<p>
		 another formulation
		 let x1=a and x2 =a+h = f(a+h) - f(a) /( h)
		 eg what is avg rate of change of f(x) =x^3 from x =1 to x=3
		 a=1 a+h =3 therefore h=2
		 avg = f(ath)-f(a) / h = 3^3 -1 / 2 =26/2 = 13
		 how can we find your instantaneous speed if your speedometer is broken
		 approximate it by calculating avg speed over a sufficiently small time interval
		 we can make the approximation as good as we like by making the time interval shorter and shorter that is closer to zero closer MEANS ZERO
	DEF: a secant line crosses a curve at 2 points or more:
	the slope of a sedcant line is avg rate of change
	def a tangent line touches the curve at some point without crossing it
	the slope is the instantaneous rate of change
	eg Find the equaion of the tangent line to the function y=x^2+x when x=2
	a=2, h is some tiny amount
	slope of secant line from x=2 to x=2th
	= f(x2) -f(x1) / x2-x1 = 2th<sup><small>2 +2th - 2</small></sup>2th / 2th - 2
	= 4 +4h +h<sup><small>2 +2+h -6   /   h	=5h+h</small></sup>2 /h
	to find the tangent line let h get close to zero
	lim h-&gt;0 5h+h^2  /  h 0/0 factor and cancel = lim 5+h = 5+0 =5
	m=5 x=2, y=? =f(2) = 2^2 +2 =6
	y=mx+b -&gt; 6= 5(2)+b b=-4 	y=5x-4
