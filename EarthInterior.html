	Seismic waves (body waves) may be reflected and refracted at density interfaces within the earth's interior, similarly to the more familiar behaviour of light rays.
	The main difference is that light waves are slowed down when moving into a more dense material, bending towards the "normal" whereas body waves speed up and bend away from the normal.

	In order for rocks to melt within the earth, the melting curve for rock must be to the left of the geotherm (the earth's temperature with depth).
	This occurs only in the outer core and asthenosphere.
	Consider that the melting curve for rock in this figure is for a wet asthenosphere. If the asthenosphere were dry, the melting temperature would be above the geotherm and upwelling mantle would not melt.
