<p>
in sped up geological time the mantle rises and falls (on hundred million year timescales)
it takes hundreds of millions of years for temperatures to lower and the mantle to fall
</p>

<p>
wrangellia was transported from 5000 km away in the southern hemisphere
Much of western north america is made up of exotic terranes accreted over 200 million years
</p>

<p>
The San Andreas fault is begininning to move north to wrangellia

<p>
ACCRETION OF A BUOYANT FRAGMENT to a continent
A buoyant fragment is carried into a plate collision zone.
Continental crust melts into the fragment
The fragment is more buoyant than the lithosphere and is not subducted
</p>

<p>
Accretion of an island arc to a continent
A plate carrying a continent subducts beneath an oceanic island arc
it welds to the continent
</p>

<p>
Accretion along a transform fault
Transform Fault -- Terrane fragment
Two plates slide past each other along a transform fault
A terrane fragment on plate b is carried along the margin of plate a
</p>

<p>
Acc by continental collision and drifting
A small continent gets pulled into a much bigger continent
once two buoyant ports combine subduction moves
</p>


<p>
Saudi arabia and africa are moving northwards
Earthquake activity indicates that this orogeny is still in progress today
