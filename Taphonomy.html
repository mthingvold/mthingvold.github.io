<p>
The study of the processes that affects an organism from the moment they die to their fossilization and subsequent discovery
</p>

<p>
	one of the main goals of taphonomy is to better understand biases in the fossil record
	Because of the fossilization process not all organisms have the same chance of being preservered ( a bias )
</p>
	
<p>
<span id="Taphonomy-Taphonomic Biases"></span><strong id="Taphonomic Biases">Taphonomic Biases</strong>
	Hard parts - organisms that contain hard parts will be better preserved
		Organisms with no hard parts make up 30-90% of any given biota but don't fossilize
		Organisms that molt are overrepresented, as one animal could leave multiple fossils over its lifespan
	Depositional environment - most fossils preserve in conditions with high sedimenttation rates in bodies of water
		organisms living in shallow seas are overrepresented in
</p>
		
<p>
	Mixing - sedimentary deposits may undergo mixing of contemporaneous with noncontemporaneous material bio/phys processes
		To what extent does a fossil deposit a true reflection of the organisms who were living there
</p>
		
<p>
		If transportation has occured fossil is allochthonous
			-as opposed to autochthonous
</p>
			
		
<p>
		Time averaging - because of the sporadic/episodic nature of deposition, turnover of individual taxa may not be reflected
</p>
<ul>
<li>
remains of successive noncontemporaneous pops may appear to live ogether

<li>
Unconformities play a major role in this

</ul>

<p>
Inaccessibility and human bias - much of the fossil record is unavailable due to the fact it isn't exposed
</p>

<p>
Other human bias due to:
	search bias: what you want is what is found
	ease of collection: easier a fossil is to identify more rep'd
	taxonomic bias: fossils easier to identify morphologically will be overrepresented
</p>

	Most hard parts are not solid material,  but porous. Pour space is occupied by organic material in life, and upon death decays.

<span id="Taphonomy-Modes of preservation"></span><strong id="Modes of preservation">Modes of preservation</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Unaltered: simple burial, some weathering

<ul>
<li>
Becomes rare further back in fossil record

</ul>
<li>
Permineralization - pour space is filled with a mineral from groundwater (Commonly silica or calcite)

<li>
Recrystalization - after burial, calcite crystals reorder and gtrow into one another (original mineralogy remains structure lost

<li>
Carbonization - Organics are compressed and distilled, leaving behind a carbon film.

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Trace fossils - The record of an organisms behavior in the fossil record:

<ul>
<li>
Trace fossils are essentially biogenerated sedimentary structures

<li>
Preserve like body fossils, in that they need to be rapidly buried

<li>
often found in env where body fossils are rare (due to baises in dep env.

</ul>
