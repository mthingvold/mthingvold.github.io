The source of ideas
Two questions:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
What is the source of our ideas? -- answer: experience

<li>
What method can we use to answer this question? -- experience and observation

</ol>

<p>
an analogy: the mind as a white sheet of paper
</p>

<p>
two remarks on "experience is the source of our ideas":
</p>
<ol>
<li>
all ideas ultimately though not necessarily directly derive from experience.

<li>
method: experience teaches us that experience is the source of knowledge.

</ol>

<p>
Questions:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
what kind of ideas obviously can't be directly derived from experience?

<li>
Are numbers derived from experience?

</ol>

<p>
Two "fountains of knowledge":
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Sensation: perceptions of what affects our senses
		ex. colors, sounds, etc

<li>
Reflections: perception the operations of our mind
		ex. perception, thought, imagination, will, emotions, etc.

</ol>
