LECTURE 6 quadratic functions and polynomial functions
</p>

<p>
	Geometrically, the uniqueness of function outputs is interpreted as the vertical line test:
	A curve in the cartesian plane is the graph of a function if and only if no vertical line crosses the curve at more than one point
			A circle is not a function
	Quadratic functions: 
		General form
			f(x)=ax^2+bx+c
			where a b c are constants -- the graph is a parabola
</p>
			
<p>
			if a&gt;0 then the parabola opens up and if a&lt;0 then the parabola opens down <span id="-def"></span><strong id="def">def</strong> the vertex of a parabola is the highest or lowest point on the graph
		Properties of quadratics
			tHE VERTEX OF A PARABola has
</p>
<blockquote>
(-b/(2a),f)-b/(2a))
</blockquote>
<p>
			the domain of any quadratic is R the range is (-inf,f(-b/(2a)] if a &lt; 0 [f(-b(/2a),inf) if a &gt; 0
			y int of a quadratic has coordinates (0,c)
			A quadratic may have 0,1,2 y ints <span id="-b<sup><small>2 - 4ac"></span><strong id="b</small></sup>2 - 4ac">b^2 - 4ac</strong> &gt;0 2 roots, = 0 is one root, &lt;0 0 roots
</p>
<blockquote>
eg find the vertex and intercepts of the given quadratic y=x<sup><small>2+9  vert= x=-b/2a = 3 and y = 3</small></sup>2 -6 * 3 + 9 = 0 x int y =9
eg y=x^2 + x + 1    vert = (-1/2) y=1  no x intercepts 
</blockquote>
				
<p>
			A common kind of word problem involving quad functions is finding the break-even points for a company: Revenue=Cost (breaking even)
</p>
<blockquote>
Profit = revenue - cost p = r - c same as saying profit = 0
</blockquote>
<p>
			If the profit is given bby a quadratic with a&lt;0 then we can find the maximum profit by finding the y-coordinate of the vertex:
</p>
<blockquote>
eg suppose tex instruments is a calc company if they sell x calcs the revenue function is 30x-x^2 and their cost function is 300-10x
find profit, break even points, where profit is max, how much is max profit.
R=30x-x<sup><small>2 C=300-10x P = R - C 	-x</small></sup>2+40x-300=P P= -(x - 10)(x - 30) 
max profit = vertex x= -b/(2a) = -40/-2 = 20
y=100
</blockquote>

<span id="-Polynomial Functions"></span><strong id="Polynomial Functions">Polynomial Functions</strong>
		A polynomial is a function that can be written in the following form f(x) = a(subn)x<sup><small>n+a(subn-1)x</small></sup>(n-1)
		where the a are real numbers(called coefficients) and n is a non-negative integer called the degree of the polynomial the highest power) 
			Linear functions are polynomials of degree 1 quadratics are polynomials of degree 2
			Degree 0: constant function
		Properties of polynomials
</p>
<ol>
<li>
The domain of every polynomial is R

<li>
the y intercept of a polynomial occurs at (0, a0)

<li>
to solve for the roots/x-intercepts of a polynomial, we must set the expression equal to zero and factor   x<sup><small>3-x=0 x(x</small></sup>2-)=0 xint=1,-1

</ol>
