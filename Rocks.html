<p>
All rocks have baggage
There aare three types of rocks
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Igneous

<li>
Metamorphic

<li>
Sedimentary

</ul>
<p>
Every Type of rock has a history
All rocks are made of minerals (121stuff)
mineral is a naturally occuring chem compound, of crystalline form and abiogenic with a specific chemical composition
</p>

<p>
	Hardness - chem bond strength
	Density - mass per volume, atomic weigghts of atoms and packing
	Fracture/cleavage - bonding creates lanes of weakness
	Crystal Habit - Arrangement of atoms and their bonds with one another form a unique crystal structure
</p>

<p>
Silicates (Olivine, Quartz)
</p>
<ul>
<li>
carbonate minerals (calcite, aragonite)

<li>
sulfite minerals (gypsum, anhydrite)

<li>
incorporates sulfate ion and is typically associated with deposits

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Oxides (Hematite, Magnetite)

<li>
Oxygen anion bonds with a metal

<li>
Native elements (gold/copper)

</ul>

<p>
Igneous Rocks
	Classified by composition and grain size
</p>
<ul>
<li>
composition:

<ul>
<li>
Felsic: granite, rhyolite

<li>
Mafic: BASALT, Gabbro

<li>
Grain Size:

<ul>
<li>
A direct reflection of the rate at which the rock cooled (Rapid: Fine grained extrusive, Slow: large grained intrusive

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
		
<p>
		Intrusive igneous rocks cool slowly and form large visible crystals --cool from magma.
		Extrusive igneous rocks cool qucikly and form microscopic crystals. --cools from lava
</p>
		
<p>
		Chemical comp can also indicate the source:
			If rocks are from magma derived from the mantle they are called mafic.
			If rocks undergo considerable mixing with continental rock, it will be felsic low in Mg and Fe and high in Si and Al
</p>
			

<div id="Metamorphic Rocks"><h3 id="Metamorphic Rocks">Metamorphic Rocks</h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
Form by alteration of other rocks at temperatures and pressures greater than at the Earth's surface

<ul>
<li>
Rocks change chemical composition without melting

<li>
Form from a parent rock which could be igneous/sedimentary/metamorphic
	The degree of change in the parent rock depends on the type and intesnity of metamorphic processes involved:

<li>
heat

<li>
Pressure

<li>
Chemical fluids

</ul>
</ul>
	
<p>
	Regional metamorphism
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Responsible for most metamorphic rocks, and is the result of mountain building at convergent boundaries

<li>
Grade * Leavel of temperature and pressure of metamorphism

<li>
Foliation * Alignment of platy minerals caused by applied pressures

</ul>

<p>
With increased temperature and pressure, there will be increasing metamorphic grade and foliation
</p>
<ul>
<li>
foliaton only occurs when specific platy minerals make up the rock composition *

<li>
Marble: Calcite/dolomite with limestone parent

<li>
Quartzite: Almost pure quartz with sandstone parent

</ul>

<p>
Contact metamorphism
</p>
<ul>
<li>
igneous intrusion "bakes" surrounding rocks

</ul>
<p>
Hydrothermal metamorphism
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Results from percolation of hot watery fluids

</ul>
<p>
Burial Metamorphism
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Similar to regional

</ul>


<p>
Sedimentary rocks form from the accumulation and lithification of bits of previously existing rock and/or organic matter.
</p>

<div id="Sedimentary"><h3 id="Sedimentary">Sedimentary</h3></div>
<p>
Bits of previously existing rock/organic matter is called sediment
because sedimentary rocks form by deposition they create horizontal beds called strata
Major divisions of sedimentary rocks reflects the type of sediment:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Siliciclastic/Detrital

<li>
Biological

<li>
Chemical

</ul>

<p>
Sediments produced by:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Weathering, erosion of other rocks

<li>
Crystals precipitated from seawater

<li>
Skeletal debris from ogranisms

</ul>
<p>
Siliciclastic/detrital rocks
	-Sed rocks composed of clasts of silicate minerals
		Cemented together with minerals from groundwater after they are buried
</p>
		
	
<p>
	Basic siliciclastic cycle:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Uplift, causing erosion

<li>
Transport through wind and/or water to a centre of deposition

<li>
Burial, resulting in lithification

<ul>
<li>
often due to cementation via dissolved minerals in groundwater

</ul>
</ol>
		
<p>
	As distance from source rock increases, so does degree of:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Roudning

<li>
Sorting

<li>
Maturity

</ul>
	
<p>
	Classification based on grain size and shape:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Gravel:

<ul>
<li>
&gt;2mm diameter

<li>
Granules, pebbles, cobbles, boulders

</ul>
<li>
Conglomerate:

<ul>
<li>
Rounded grains

</ul>
<li>
Breccia:

<ul>
<li>
Angular grain

</ul>
<li>
Sand:

<ul>
<li>
1/16 - 2mm diameter

<li>
often quartz

<li>
sandstone

</ul>
<li>
Silt:

<ul>
<li>
1/256-1/16mm

</ul>
<li>
Clay/Mud:

<ul>
<li>
Smaller than 1/256 mm

</ul>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>
Mudstones:

<ul>
<li>
Shale

<ul>
<li>
Fissile mudstone

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>


<p>
Evaporties
</p>

<p>
Form from evaporation of seawater:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Anhydrite

<li>
Gypsum

<li>
Halite

</ul>
<p>
readily formed, readily dissolved
</p>

<p>
Chert
</p>

<ul>
<li>
extremely small quartz crystals precipitated from watery solutions

<li>
Brown, gray, or black impurities

<li>
Flint

</ul>


<p>
Any Sedimentary rock that is made from biological material is biological in nature: Coal and limestones
</p>

<p>
Carbonates:
Limestone:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Often formed from skeletal particles of organisms that secrete calcium carbonate

<li>
Typically forms in warm, shallow sea water

<li>
Dissolves relatively easily in water, and in acid

<li>
Commonly deposited as:

<ul>
<li>
Fossil reef (fossilifeous limestone)

<li>
Shelled mollusk accumulation (bioclastic limestone)

<li>
Accumulation of microscopic organsims with calcareous shells (chalks)

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
Sedimentary Structures
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Distinctive arrangements of grains in sedimentary rocks

<li>
Reflect modes of deposition

<li>

</ul>
<p>
Ripples
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Structures formed by wind or water

<li>
Sedimets accumulate downlope

<li>
Symmetrical → Bidirectional current

<li>
Assymetrical → unidirectional current

</ul>
