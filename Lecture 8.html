<p>
In sum 
</p>
<ol>
<li>
we perceive some qualities of the objects by means of one sense; others by means of another.

<li>
The qualities we perceive by means one sense, we don't perceive by means of another sense.

<li>
Nothing in the fact that i sense something tells me what my sensation is a sensation of: the color of the thing, the taste of something, etc

<li>
Nothing in the fact that i sense something tells me what my itself sensation is: a sight, a taste, a touch etc.

<li>
The mind determines what sense perceives what quality of what object

</ol>

<p>
Empiricism:
ultimately, all our knowledge derives from experience ( i.e. sense experience)
(How do we know? Experience tells us.)
Rationalism:
In significant ways, our knowledge is gained independently of sense experience.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
The setting of descartes second medititation

<ol>
<li>
The whirlpool:
		it feelse as if i have fallen unexpectedly into a deep whirlppool which tumbles me around so that i can neither stand on the bottom nor swim up to the top. (p.16)

<li>
finding a first certainty:
		"Anything which admits of the slightest doubt i will set aside."

</ol>
<li>
rchimedes fixed point:
	Archimedes greek mathematician, physicisist and engineer from the city of syracuse
	principle of the lever:
	Magnitudes are in equilibrium at distances reciprocally proportional to their weights.

</ol>
	
<p>
	on this analogy we are looking for:
		1/ an absolute certainty
		2/ an extroardinary cetainty
		3/ a purely rational certainty
	What kind of certainty can we hope to find?
		1/a self-standing certainty
		2/ A generative certainty
		3/ A heuristic certainty
</p>
		
<p>
	The cogito argument: p16-17?
		1/ I doubt everything, and I don't yet have a reason to stop doubting. But as i am doubting all these things, I must exist.
		2/ deceiving god can't deceive me if i don't exist
		3/ Then as long as i think  that i exist, no deceiving god can convince me that i don't exist.
		4/ Therefore: I am, I exist is necessarily true whenever it is put forward or conceived in my mind.
</p>
		
<p>
	2 quesitons
		What is established exactly?
		How exactly is this established?
	1/ what is established in cog arg?
		A. But i don not have a sufficient understanding of what I am even though i know i exist"
		B. But what then am I? A thing that thinks.
