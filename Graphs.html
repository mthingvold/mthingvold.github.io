A graph G consists of 	
</p>
<ul>
<li>
a set of vertices, V(G)

<li>
a set of edges E(G)
	Each edge is associated with either one or two vertices called its endpoints. An edge connects its endpoints. A vertex is incident to an edge if the vertex is an endpoint of the edge. two vertices connected by an edge are adjacent

</ul>
	
<p>
	An edge with only one endpoint is a loop, and two or more edges with the same endpoints are said to be parallel.
	Simple graph won't contain these
</p>
	
<p>
Handshake theorem:
	The sum of the degrees of all the vertices of a graph G is equal to twice the number of edges in G.
	Proof:
		By induction on the number of edges in the graph = m
		Basis case: m=0
		In a graph with no edges, the sum of the degrees of all the vertices in the graph is zero, which is also twice the number

The theorems were not typically important, but the theorem forms were.

<span id="-Cycle"></span><strong id="Cycle">Cycle</strong>
A cycle in a graph is a simple circuit that contains at least one edge.
</p>

<p>
<span id="-Trees"></span><strong id="Trees">Trees</strong>
A tree is a graph which is connected, but contains no cycle. A forest is a graph which contains no cycle.
</p>

Theorem: If a tree T = (V,E) has n&gt;1 vertices, then T has at least 2 vertices of degree 1.
</p>

<p>
Proof: By induction on n. 
Basis Case: n=2 The only tree with two vertices consists of the two vertices connected by an edge.
</p>

<p>
Inductive Hypothesis:
Assume that all trees with at least 2, but at most k verses have at least 2 vertices of degree 1.
</p>

<p>
Inductive step: consider a tree T with n=k+1 vertices. Let e = (u,v) be an edge in T.
</p>

<p>
Proceed by cases:
Case 1: Both u and v are of degree 1.  
This case cannot occur as T has at least three vertices, and it could not be connected if two adjacent vertices were of degree one.
Case 2: Exactly one of u or v are of degree 1.
Assume u is of degree 1. Let Tv be the subtree of T

Rooted trees
A rooted tree is a tree with one vertex designated as the root of the tree
The level of avertex u in  a rooted tree is the number of edges along the unique path between u and the root. 
The height of a rooted tree is the maximum level of a vertex in the tree
parent: for each vertex u, except the root, of a rooted tree the vertex adjacent to u, but at level one less than that of u is the parent of u.
Child: for a vertex u in a rooted tree, the vertices adjacent to u but at level one greater than u are the children of u
leaf: a vertex in a rooted tree with no children is called a leaf.
</p>


<p>
Binary Trees:
A binary tree is a rooted tree in which every parent has at most 2 children.
