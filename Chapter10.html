Externality - the uncompensated impact of a person's  actions on the well-being of a bystander
</p>
<ul>
<li>
negative ext : impact on bystander is bad

<li>
pos ext : impact on bystander is good

<li>
buyers and sellers fail to consider externalities when doing the best thing for themselves, so market equilibrium != max total benefit to all of society once you consider externalities

</ul>

<p>
Externalities Market inefficiences**
social cdost : private cost + ext cost to bystanders
supply ( cost to marg seller = cost to the producer of the last unit sold)
demand (shows willingness to pay marginal buyer = value of good to customer of the last unit bought
making aluminum =pollution so the social cost equals private costsof producers + cost to bystanders
benevolent social planner chooses level of aluminum production at optimum
at market equilibrium , consumer surplus is the triangle are under the demand curve and above equilibrium price (Pmarket) A+B+C+D
cost to society =area  under social cost curve + market qty
amount of money received by sellers = qty sold * price (Qmarket*Pmarket) E+F+G
producer surplus = received by sellers - cost to society
total surplus = consumer surplus + producer surplus
</p>

<p>
at optimum, consumer surplus is reduced to D
producer surplus = amount received by sellers at Poptimum - social cost of producing Qoptimum units
</p>

<p>
Changes that occurs when going from Qmarket to Qoptimum:
	consumer surplus down by area A+B+C
	producer surplus up by area A+B+C+H
	total surplus down by are H: deadweight loss reduction of total surplus bc pollution
</p>
	
<p>
Social planner achieves Qoptimum+eliminates deadweight loss by taxing alum producers
</p>
<ul>
<li>
the supply curve would shift up depending on size of tax

<li>
if tax = external cost of pollution, supply curve shifts up to equal socail cost curves

<li>
in new market equilibrium, producers would makes optimim qty

<li>
use of 4 such a tax: internalizing the externality - alter incentives so people take account of external effects of their actions

</ul>

<p>
Public policy towards externalities;
regulate behoavior
pollution permits
not always as easy as outright forbidding something
</p>

<p>
market based policy 1 : corrective taxes+subsidies
</p>

<ul>
<li>
gov't can use market - based policies to align private incentives w/ sociial 

</ul>
  
<p>
  similarities between corrective tax + pollution permits
  	in both cases firms pay
</p>
	
<p>
	both case internalize the externality of pollution
</p>
	
<p>
demand curve shows that when price of polluting down more firms will choose to pollute
</p>

<p>
corrective tax: sets price for pollution, supply curve perfectly elastic ( firms can pollute as much as they want by paying tax, where it intersects D curve is qty
</p>

<p>
some people say it's not right to allow pollute for fee
</p>

<p>
rich countries can afford better environment care
</p>

<p>
transaction costs: costs that parties incur in the process of agreeing to and following through on a bargain
</p>

<p>
-&gt; ex. a translator's price if the 2 people speak different languages
</p>

<p>
bargaining breaks down: each hold out for better deal
when the # of parties involved is high, coord of everyone is difficult
when private solutions don't work the gov can step in
